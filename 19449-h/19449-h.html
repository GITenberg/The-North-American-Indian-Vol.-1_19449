        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">In Mr. Curtis we have
        both an artist and a trained observer, whose pictures are pictures,
        not merely photographs; whose work has far more than mere accuracy,
        because it is truthful. All serious students are to be congratulated
        because he is putting his work in permanent form; for our generation
        offers the last chance for doing what Mr. Curtis has done. The Indian
        as he has hitherto been is on the point of passing away. His life has
        been lived under conditions thru which our own race past so many ages
        ago that not a vestige of their memory remains. It would be a
        veritable calamity if a vivid and truthful record of these conditions
        were not kept. No one man alone could preserve such a record in
        complete form. Others have worked in the past, and are working in the
        present, to preserve parts of the record; but Mr. Curtis, because of
        the singular combination of qualities with which he has been blest,
        and because of his extraordinary success in making and using his
        opportunities, has been able to do what no other man ever has done;
        what, as far as we can see, no other man could do. He is an artist
        who works out of doors and not in the closet. He is a close observer,
        whose qualities of mind and body fit him to make his observations out
        in the field, surrounded by the wild life he commemorates. He has
        lived on intimate terms with many different tribes of the mountains
        and the plains. He knows them as they hunt, as they travel, as they
        go about their various avocations on the march and in the camp. He
        knows their medicine men and sorcerers, their chiefs and warriors,
        their young men and maidens. He has not only seen their vigorous
        outward existence, but has caught glimpses, such as few white men
        ever catch, into that strange spiritual and mental life of theirs;
        from whose innermost recesses all white men are forever barred. Mr.
        Curtis in publishing this book is rendering a real and great service;
        a service not only to our own people, but to the world of scholarship
        everywhere.</span></span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The task of
        recording the descriptive material embodied in these volumes, and of
        preparing the photographs which accompany them, had its inception in
        1898. Since that time, during each year, months of arduous labor have
        been spent in accumulating the data necessary to form a comprehensive
        and permanent record of all the important tribes of the United States
        and Alaska that still retain to a considerable degree their primitive
        customs and traditions. The value of such a work, in great measure,
        will lie in the breadth of its treatment, in its wealth of
        illustration, and in the fact that it represents the result of
        personal study of a people who are rapidly losing the traces of their
        aboriginal character and who are destined ultimately to become
        assimilated with the "superior race."</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It has been the
        aim to picture all features of the Indian life and environment—types
        of the young and the old, with their habitations, industries,
        ceremonies, games, and everyday customs. Rather than being designed
        for mere embellishment, the photographs are each an illustration of
        an Indian character or of some vital phase in his existence. Yet the
        fact that the Indian and his surroundings lend themselves to artistic
        treatment has not been lost sight of, for in his country one may
        treat limitless subjects of an æsthetic character without in any way
        doing injustice to scientific accuracy or neglecting the homelier
        phases of aboriginal life. Indeed, in a work of this sort, to
        overlook those marvellous touches that Nature has given to the Indian
        country, and for the origin of which the native ever has a
        wonder-tale to relate, would be to neglect a most important chapter
        in the story of an environment that made the Indian much of what he
        is. Therefore, being directly from Nature, the accompanying pictures
        show what actually exists or has recently existed (for many of the
        subjects have<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexiv">[pg
        xiv]</span><a name="Pgxiv" id="Pgxiv" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        already passed forever), not what the artist in his studio may
        presume the Indian and his surroundings to be.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The task has not
        been an easy one, for although lightened at times by the readiness of
        the Indians to impart their knowledge, it more often required days
        and weeks of patient endeavor before my assistants and I succeeded in
        overcoming the deep-rooted superstition, conservatism, and
        secretiveness so characteristic of primitive people, who are ever
        loath to afford a glimpse of their inner life to those who are not of
        their own. Once the confidence of the Indians gained, the way led
        gradually through the difficulties, but long and serious study was
        necessary before knowledge of the esoteric rites and ceremonies could
        be gleaned.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At times the
        undertaking was made congenial by our surroundings in beautiful
        mountain wild, in the depths of primeval forest, in the refreshing
        shade of cañon wall, or in the homes and sacred places of the Indians
        themselves; while at others the broiling desert sun, the sand-storm,
        the flood, the biting blast of winter, lent anything but pleasure to
        the task.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The word-story of
        this primitive life, like the pictures, must be drawn direct from
        Nature. Nature tells the story, and in Nature's simple words I can
        but place it before the reader. In great measure it must be written
        as these lines are—while I am in close touch with the Indian
        life.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the moment I am
        seated by a beautiful brook that bounds through the forests of
        Apacheland. Numberless birds are singing their songs of life and
        love. Within my reach lies a tree, felled only last night by a
        beaver, which even now darts out into the light, scans his
        surroundings, and scampers back. A covey of mourning doves fly to the
        water's edge, slake their thirst in their dainty way, and flutter
        off. By the brookside path now and then wander prattling children; a
        youth and a maiden hand in hand wend their way along the cool
        stream's brink. The words of the children and the lovers are unknown
        to me, but the story of childhood and love needs no
        interpreter.</p><a name="fig7" id="fig7"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is thus near to
        Nature that much of the life of the Indian still is; hence its story,
        rather than being replete with statistics of<span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="pagexv">[pg xv]</span><a name="Pgxv" id="Pgxv" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> commercial conquests, is a record of the
        Indian's relations with and his dependence on the phenomena of the
        universe—the trees and shrubs, the sun and stars, the lightning and
        rain,—for these to him are animate creatures. Even more than that,
        they are deified, therefore are revered and propitiated, since upon
        them man must depend for his well-being. To the workaday man of our
        own race the life of the Indian is just as incomprehensible as are
        the complexities of civilization to the mind of the untutored
        savage.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While primarily a
        photographer, I do not see or think photographically; hence the story
        of Indian life will not be told in microscopic detail, but rather
        will be presented as a broad and luminous picture. And I hope that
        while our extended observations among these brown people have given
        no shallow insight into their life and thought, neither the pictures
        nor the descriptive matter will be found lacking in popular
        interest.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Though the
        treatment accorded the Indians by those who lay claim to civilization
        and Christianity has in many cases been worse than criminal, a
        rehearsal of these wrongs does not properly find a place here.
        Whenever it may be necessary to refer to some of the unfortunate
        relations that have existed between the Indians and the white race,
        it will be done in that unbiased manner becoming the student of
        history. As a body politic recognizing no individual ownership of
        lands, each Indian tribe naturally resented encroachment by another
        race, and found it impossible to relinquish without a struggle that
        which belonged to their people from time immemorial. On the other
        hand, the white man whose very own may have been killed or captured
        by a party of hostiles forced to the warpath by the machinations of
        some unscrupulous Government employé, can see nothing that is good in
        the Indian. There are thus two sides to the story, and in these
        volumes such questions must be treated with impartiality.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nor is it our
        purpose to theorize on the origin of the Indians—a problem that has
        already resulted in the writing of a small library, and still with no
        satisfactory solution. The object of the work is to record by word
        and picture what the Indian is, not<span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "pagexvi">[pg xvi]</span><a name="Pgxvi" id="Pgxvi" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> whence he came. Even with this in view the
        years of a single life are insufficient for the task of treating in
        minute detail all the intricacies of the social structure and the
        arts and beliefs of many tribes. Nevertheless, by reaching beneath
        the surface through a study of his creation myths, his legends and
        folklore, more than a fair impression of the mode of thought of the
        Indian can be gained. In each instance all such material has been
        gathered by the writer and his assistants from the Indians direct,
        and confirmed, so far as is possible, through repetition by other
        members of their tribe.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Ever since the
        days of Columbus the assertion has been made repeatedly that the
        Indian has no religion and no code of ethics, chiefly for the reason
        that in his primitive state he recognizes no supreme God. Yet the
        fact remains that no people have a more elaborate religious system
        than our aborigines, and none are more devout in the performance of
        the duties connected therewith. There is scarcely an act in the
        Indian's life that does not involve some ceremonial performance or is
        not in itself a religious act, sometimes so complicated that much
        time and study are required to grasp even a part of its real meaning,
        for his myriad deities must all be propitiated lest some dire
        disaster befall him.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Likewise with
        their arts, which casual observers have sometimes denied the Indians;
        yet, to note a single example, the so-called "Digger" Indians, who
        have been characterized as in most respects the lowest type of all
        our tribes, are makers of delicately woven baskets, embellished with
        symbolic designs and so beautiful in form as to be works of art in
        themselves.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The great changes
        in practically every phase of the Indian's life that have taken
        place, especially within recent years, have been such that had the
        time for collecting much of the material, both descriptive and
        illustrative, herein recorded, been delayed, it would have been lost
        forever. The passing of every old man or woman means the passing of
        some tradition, some knowledge of sacred rites possessed by no other;
        consequently the information that is to be gathered, for the benefit
        of future generations, respecting the mode of life of one of the
        great races of mankind, must be<span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "pagexvii">[pg xvii]</span><a name="Pgxvii" id="Pgxvii" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> collected at once or the opportunity will be
        lost for all time. It is this need that has inspired the present
        task.</p><a name="fig8" id="fig8"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In treating the
        various tribes it has been deemed advisable that a geographic rather
        than an ethnologic grouping be presented, but without losing sight of
        tribal relationships, however remote the cognate tribes may be one
        from another. To simplify the study and to afford ready reference to
        the salient points respecting the several tribes, a summary of the
        information pertaining to each is given in the appendices.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the spelling of
        the native terms throughout the text, as well as in the brief
        vocabularies appended to each volume, the simplest form possible,
        consistent with approximate accuracy, has been adopted. No attempt
        has been made to differentiate sounds so much alike that the average
        student fails to discern the distinction, for the words, where
        recorded, are designed for the general reader rather than the
        philologist, and it has been the endeavor to encourage their
        pronunciation rather than to make them repellent by inverted and
        other arbitrary characters.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I take this
        opportunity to express my deep appreciation to those who have so
        generously lent encouragement during these years of my labor, from
        the humblest dwellers in frontier cabins to the captains of industry
        in our great commercial centres, and from the representatives of the
        most modest institutions of learning to those whose fame is
        worldwide. Without this encouragement the work could not have been
        accomplished. When the last opportunity for study of the living
        tribes shall have passed with the Indians themselves, and the day
        cannot be far off, my generous friends may then feel that they have
        aided in a work the results of which, let it be hoped, will grow more
        valuable as time goes on.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While it is the
        plan of this work to treat the tribes in the order of their
        geographic distribution, rather than to group them in accordance with
        their relationship one to another, we are fortunate, in the present
        volume, to have for treatment two important southwestern Indian
        groups—the Navaho and the Apache—which are not only connected
        linguistically but have been more or less in proximity ever since
        they have been known to history.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Because of his
        cunning, his fearlessness, and his long resistance to subjection both
        by the missionary and by the governments under whose dominion he has
        lived, but until recent times never recognized, the Apache, in name
        at least, has become one of the best known of our tribal groups. But,
        ever the scourge of the peaceable Indians that dwelt in adjacent
        territory, and for about three hundred years a menace to the brave
        colonists that dared settle within striking distance of him, the
        Apache of Arizona and New Mexico occupied a region that long remained
        a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">terra
        incognita</span></span>, while the inner life of its occupants was a
        closed book.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is little
        wonder, then, that we have known practically nothing of the Apache
        and their customs beyond the meagre record of what has been given us
        by a few army officers; consequently their study was entered into
        with especial interest. Although much time was expended and much
        patience consumed before the confidence of their elders was gained,
        the work was finally successful, as will be seen particularly by the
        creation legend and the accompanying mythologic picture-writing on
        deerskin, which give an insight into the mode of thought of this
        people and a comprehensive idea of the belief respecting their
        genesis. Not satisfied with the story as first related by the
        medicine-men lest error perchance should have crept in, it
        was<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexx">[pg xx]</span><a name="Pgxx"
        id="Pgxx" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> repeated and verified by others
        until no doubt of its entire accuracy remained. It is especially
        fortunate that the chief investigations were made in the summer of
        1906, when the new "messiah craze" was at its height, thus affording
        exceptional opportunity for observing an interesting wave of
        religious ecstasy sweep over this primitive folk.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Navaho tribe,
        second only to the Sioux in numbers, have been the least affected by
        civilizing influences. The Navaho is the American Bedouin, the chief
        human touch in the great plateau-desert region of our Southwest,
        acknowledging no superior, paying allegiance to no king in name of
        chief, a keeper of flocks and herds who asks nothing of the
        Government but to be unmolested in his pastoral life and in the
        religion of his forebears. Although the mythology and ceremonials of
        this virile people would alone furnish material for many volumes, it
        is believed that even with the present comparatively brief treatment
        a comprehensive view of their character and activities will be
        gained.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is with
        pleasure that I acknowledge the able assistance rendered by Mr. W. W.
        Phillips and Mr. W. E. Myers during the last two years of field work
        in collecting and arranging the material for this volume, and the aid

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Indian and
          his history present innumerable problems to the student. Facts
          seemingly contradict facts, well-founded theories contradict other
          theories as well founded. Linguistically the Apache belong to the
          great Athapascan family, which, according to the consensus of
          opinion, had its origin in the far North, where many tribes of the
          family still live. Based on the creation legends of the Navaho and
          on known historical events, the advent of the southern branch of
          this linguistic group—the Navaho and the Apache tribes—has been
          fixed in the general region in which they now have their home, at
          about the time of the discovery of America. Contrary to this
          conclusion, however, the legend of their genesis gives no hint of
          an origin in other than their historical habitat. The history and
          the legendary lore of the Indian are passed down from generation to
          generation, so that it would seem hardly credible that all trace of
          this migration from a distant region should have become lost within
          a period of somewhat more than four hundred years.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again, judging
          by the similarity in language, the Apache and the Navaho in
          prehistoric times were as nearly a single group as the present
          bands of Apache are; and, likewise, there is sufficient similarity
          in the underlying principles of their mythology to argue a common
          tribal origin. The names as well as the functions of several of the
          mythic characters are identical in both tribes, as, for example,
          the war gods Nayé̆nĕzganĭ and Tobadzĭschí̆nĭ. These
          miracle-performing twins in each case are the sons of a woman (who
          occupies an almost identical position in both Navaho and Apache
          mythology) and the sun and water respectively. Pollen also is
          deified by each—as Hádĭntĭn Boy among the Apache and Tádĭtĭn Boy
          among the Navaho. If, therefore, we may concede that the Navaho and
          the Apache were originally<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page004">[pg
          004]</span><a name="Pg004" id="Pg004" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          one tribe, as their language certainly indicates, we have many
          arguments in favor of the theory of long residence in the
          South-west of this branch of the Athapascan family, for the
          striking differences in the details of their myths would seem to
          indicate that the tribal separation was not a recent one, and that
          the mythology of the two tribes became changed in the course of its
          natural development along different lines or through accretion of
          other peoples since the original segregation. The Apache story of
          their creation portrays human beings in their present form, while
          in the Navaho genesis myth occurs the remarkable story,
          unquestionably aboriginal, of the evolution of the lower animals
          through successive underworlds until the present world is reached,
          then as spirit people miraculously creating human life.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The beautiful
          genesis myth of the Apache is complete; it does not reflect an
          incipient primitive culture, but one developed by age. The
          mythology and ceremonial of the Navaho exhibit unquestioned signs
          of being composite in origin. Their ceremonials are perhaps the
          most elaborate of any Indians except the Pueblos; indeed the very
          life of this people so teems with ceremony as almost to pass
          comprehension. The Navaho ritual probably reached its highest phase
          about the beginning of the nineteenth century. It would seem
          impossible for a religion so highly developed as this to have
          attained such a stage within a comparatively short time.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before the early
          years of the seventeenth century the Spanish chroniclers give us
          nothing definite regarding the Apache of what is now Arizona and
          New Mexico, but there are numerous accounts of their aggressiveness
          from this time onward.</p><a name="fig18" id="fig18"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Father Francisco
          Garcés, who in 1775-76 journeyed from his mission of San Xavier del
          Bac, in southern Arizona, to San Gabriel, California, thence to the
          Hopi country, and back to his mission by way of the Colorado and
          the Gila rivers, had sufficient knowledge of the Apache to keep
          well out of their country, for they had ever been enemies of
          Garcés' peaceful neophytes, the Papago and the Pima. To the
          warlike, marauding Apache Garcés gave much thought, drawing up a
          plan for holding them in subjection<span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page005">[pg 005]</span><a name="Pg005" id="Pg005" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> by the establishment of a cordon of
          presidios. To read his simple plan and compare the ineffectual
          efforts of the Americans, who had the Apache country virtually
          surrounded by military posts for many years, will convince one that
          while Garcés held the Apache in justifiable fear, he little knew
          the true character of those with whom he was reckoning.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So far as
          diligent field research reveals, there was but one tribe or band of
          Indians living within proximity of the Apache Indians of Arizona in
          early times who ever affiliated with them, or associated with them
          in any way save on terms of enmity. This tribe was the
          Apache-Mohave, of Yuman stock, whose domain extended along the Rio
          Verde in central Arizona, immediately adjacent to the territory
          over which the Apache proper held undisputed sway. With these,
          affiliation practically became fusion, for in outward semblance,
          characteristics, mode of living, and handicraft they are typically
          Apache; but their mother tongue, though impaired, and remnants of
          their native mythology are still adhered to. Through the
          Apache-Mohave, allied with the Apache since early times, and
          resembling them so closely as to have almost escaped segregation
          until recent years, did the tribe now so widely known as Apache
          undoubtedly receive its name.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
          Apache-Mohave call themselves <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Apátĭĕh</span></span>, which means, simply,
          "people." The Walapai, another Yuman tribe farther north, whose
          dialect resembles that of the Apache-Mohave more closely than do
          the dialects of the Mohave and the Yuma, also call themselves
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Apátĭĕh</span></span>. Although the
          pronunciation of this word is indicated more nearly correctly by
          this spelling than by "Apache," only a trained ear can distinguish
          the difference in sound when the average Yuman Indian utters it.
          Etymologically it comes from <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">apá</span></span>, "man," and the plural
          suffix -<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">tĭĕh</span></span>.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The mountain
          fastness of the Apache in Arizona permitted easiest approach from
          the south and the west for all who wished to seek peace or revenge.
          The Apache-Mohave, living as Apache in close affiliation, were on
          the western border of this stronghold, whence they made raids upon
          several other Yuman groups, north, west, and south, in company with
          the Apache. They were also<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page006">[pg
          006]</span><a name="Pg006" id="Pg006" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          the first to be attacked by enemies waging offensive warfare, hence
          any name by which they designated themselves might readily have
          been transmitted to the whole Apache group. Early Spanish
          missionaries alluded to the Apache-Mohave as true Apache.
          Contradistinguished from the Apache proper, the Apache-Mohave are
          called Yavapai and Yavapĕh by their congeners of the Colorado
          river, a term that has been employed by early writers, misled
          through the close association of the Apache-Mohave with the Apache,
          to designate also the latter people. It is further evident that the
          term Apache came to be applied to this great division of the
          Athapascan family indirectly, as its component tribes are not known
          by that name in any of the Indian languages of the Southwest, and
          there is no evidence of its being of other than Indian
          origin.</p><a name="fig19" id="fig19"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Since known to
          history, the many bands of Apache have occupied the mountains and
          plains of southern Arizona and New Mexico, northern Sonora and
          Chihuahua, and western Texas—an area greater than that of the
          states of New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Connecticut,
          Massachusetts, Vermont, Maine, Ohio, North Carolina, South
          Carolina, and West Virginia. They were always known as "wild"
          Indians, and indeed their early warfare with all neighboring
          tribes, as well as their recent persistent hostility toward our
          Government, which precipitated a "war of extermination," bear out
          the appropriateness of the designation. An admission of fear of
          anything is hard to elicit from the weakest of Indian tribes, but
          all who lived within raiding distance of the Apache, save the
          Navaho, their Athapascan cousins, freely admit that for generations
          before their subjugation the Apache were constantly held in mortal
          terror.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Through the
          constant depredations carried on against the Mexican settlements in
          northern Sonora and Chihuahua, under the leadership of Juan José,
          an Apache chief educated among the Mexicans, those two states were
          led, in 1837, to offer a bounty for Apache scalps. The horror of
          this policy lay in the fact that the scalp of a friendly Indian
          brought the same reward as that of the fiercest warrior, and worse
          still, no exception was made of<span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page007">[pg 007]</span><a name="Pg007" id="Pg007" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> women or children. Nothing could have been
          more effective than this scalp bounty in arousing all the savagery
          in these untamed denizens of the mountains, and both Mexico and the
          United States paid dearly in lives for every Apache scalp taken
          under this barbarous system. Predatory warfare continued unabated
          during the next forty years in spite of all the Mexican government
          could do. With the consummation of the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo,
          in 1848, the Apache problem became one to be solved by the United
          States as well.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In 1864, under
          General James H. Carleton, the "war of extermination" was begun in
          a most systematic manner. On April 20 this officer communicated a
          proposal of co-operation to Don Ignacio Pesqueira, Governor of
          Sonora, saying: "If your excellency will put a few hundred men into
          the field on the first day of next June, and keep them in hot
          pursuit of the Apaches of Sonora, say for sixty or ninety days, we
          will either exterminate the Indians or so diminish their numbers
          that they will cease their murdering and robbing propensities and
          live at peace."</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This request was
          met. The settlers in Arizona, under agreement, placed a force in
          the field provisioned with army supplies. Several hundred Pima,
          Papago, and Maricopa Indians also were supplied with guns,
          ammunition, and clothing, and pressed into service; but a year's
          effort netted the combined forces little gain. Although two hundred
          Apache were killed and many head of stolen stock recovered,
          practically no advance toward the termination of hostilities was
          accomplished.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In April, 1865,
          Inspector-General Davis arranged a conference at the Copper Mines
          in New Mexico with Victorio, Nané, Acosta, and other chiefs, among
          whom were Pasquin, Cassari, and Salvador, sons of Mangas Coloradas,
          through which he learned of the existence of dire destitution among
          the Apache and a desire for peace on condition that they be
          permitted to occupy their native haunts. But the Government had
          adopted a policy of removal by which the Arizona Apache desiring
          peace should join the Mescaleros at the Bosque Redondo in New
          Mexico. To this they flatly refused to agree, and the warfare
          continued.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page008">[pg

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Practically all
          the Apache were assembled in Arizona in 1865, and waged hostilities
          with renewed energy for the next five years, being joined by the
          Walapai in 1868. The close of this period found the situation quite
          as unsettled as ever.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On June 4, 1871,
          General George Crook was placed in command. Crook was not an
          exterminator. In the fall of the same year he said:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"I think that
          the Apache is painted in darker colors than he deserves, and that
          his villainies arise more from a misconception of facts than from
          his being worse than other Indians. Living in a country the natural
          products of which will not support him, he has either to cultivate
          the soil or steal, and as our vacillating policy satisfies him we
          are afraid of him, he chooses the latter, also as requiring less
          labor and being more congenial to his natural instincts. I am
          satisfied that a sharp, active campaign against him would not only
          make him one of the best Indians in the country, but it would also
          save millions of dollars to the Treasury, and the lives of many
          innocent whites and Indians."</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Crook's policy
          was one of peace, but he made it plain to the Indians that if they
          did not agree to peace when liberal terms were offered, they could
          expect a campaign against them hitherto unequalled in vigor. It was
          thus that by 1873 the Tontos, Coyoteros, and Apache-Mohave were
          subdued and the backbone of Apache resistance broken.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
          Apache-Mohave and the Tontos were placed on a reservation on the
          Rio Verde; the Coyoteros were taken to the White Mountain district
          near Fort Apache; the Pinaleños and parts of other bands
          surrendered and were established at San Carlos; in all,
          approximately three thousand Apache had been brought under control.
          About one thousand hostiles yet remained in the mountains, but by
          1874 they had become so nearly subjugated as to make it seem
          advisable to transfer the Arizona reservations from the War
          Department to the Office of Indian Affairs, which was done. The
          policy of the Indian Office from the beginning had been to
          concentrate the various bands upon one reservation at San Carlos.
          Disaffection arose between different bands<span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page009">[pg 009]</span><a name="Pg009" id="Pg009" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> until this became a despicable place to
          nearly all, while continued adherence to the removal policy drove
          the Chiricahua from their southern Arizona reservation to seek
          refuge with the Ojo Caliente Apache in southwestern New Mexico, in
          1876, although they had been living in comparative peace for four
          years. In 1877 these Chiricahua and the Ojo Caliente band were
          forcibly removed to San Carlos, but while en route Victorio and a
          party of forty warriors made their escape. In September of the same
          year three hundred more fled from San Carlos and settler after
          settler was murdered. In February, 1878, Victorio and his notorious
          band surrendered at Ojo Caliente, but gave notice that they would
          die fighting before submitting to removal to San Carlos. The major
          portion of the three hundred Chiricahua who had left San Carlos
          surrendered at Fort Wingate, New Mexico, shortly before. All these
          were taken to the Mescalero reservation in New Mexico.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Haunted by the
          dread of removal to San Carlos, the appearance of a party of Grant
          County officials at the Mescalero agency on a hunting tour a few
          months later caused Victorio and his band to flee with a number of
          Chiricahua and Mescaleros to the mountains of southern New
          Mexico.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For two years,
          until he met his death at the hands of Mexican troops in the fall
          of 1880, Victorio spread carnage throughout the southern portions
          of Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona, and the northern states of
          Mexico, enlisting the aid of every willing renegade or refugee of
          whatever band or tribe in that section. After him Nané, Chato, Juh,
          Geronimo, and other doughty hostiles carried the fighting and
          raiding along until June, 1883, when Crook, reassigned to the
          Arizona district, followed the Chiricahua band under Geronimo into
          the Sierra Madre in Chihuahua, whence he brought them back whipped
          and ready to accept offers of peace. The captives were placed upon
          the San Carlos and White Mountain reservations, where, with the
          various other Apache bands under military surveillance, and with
          Crook in control, they took up agriculture with alacrity. But in
          1885 Crook's authority was curtailed, and through some cause,
          never<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page010">[pg 010]</span><a name=
          "Pg010" id="Pg010" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> quite clear,
          Geronimo with many Chiricahua followers again took the warpath.
          Crook being relieved at his own request, Gen. Nelson A. Miles was
          assigned the task of finally subduing the Apache, which was
          consummated by the recapture of Geronimo and his band in the Sierra
          Madre in September, 1886. These hostiles were taken as prisoners to
          Florida, later to Alabama, and thence to Fort Sill, Oklahoma,
          where, numbering 298, they still are, living as farmers in peace
          and quiet, but still under the control of the military
          authorities.</p><a name="fig21" id="fig21"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One of the last
          hostile movements of note was the so-called Cibicu fight in 1882.
          In the spring of that year an old medicine-man, Nabakéltĭ,
          Attacking The Enemy, better known as Doklínĭ, started a "medicine"
          craze in the valley of the Cibicu on the White Mountain
          reservation. He had already a considerable following, and now
          claimed divine revelation and dictated forms of procedure in
          bringing the dead to life. As medicine paraphernalia he made sixty
          large wheels of wood, painted symbolically, and twelve sacred
          sticks, one of which, in the form of a cross, he designated "chief
          of sticks." Then with sixty men he commenced his dance.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One morning at
          dawn Nabakéltĭ went to the grave of a man who had been prominent in
          the tribe and who had recently died. He and his adherents danced
          about the grave and then dug up the bones, around which they danced
          four times in a circle. The dancing occupied the entire morning,
          and early in the afternoon they went to another grave, where the
          performance was repeated. In each instance the bones were left
          exposed; but later four men, specially delegated, went to the
          graves and erected a brush hut over the remains.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nabakéltĭ told
          the people that they must pray each morning for four days, at the
          end of which time the bleached bones would be found clothed with
          flesh and alive again. By the end of the second day the Apache band
          on the Cibicu became excited almost to the degree of frenzy. They
          watched the little grave-houses constantly and gathered in groups
          about other graves.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Some of the
          Apache employed as scouts with the detachment stationed at Fort
          Apache heard of the craze and obtained<span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page011">[pg 011]</span><a name="Pg011" id="Pg011" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> leave of absence to investigate. They
          returned and informed the commanding officer, then acting as agent,
          that their people were going mad, whereupon a number of scouts and
          troopers were sent to learn the cause of the trouble and to ask
          Nabakéltĭ to come to the fort for an interview. Though angered by
          the message, the old man agreed to come in two days. Meanwhile he
          had the little brush houses over the bones tightly sealed to keep
          out preying animals and curious Indians. He then explained to his
          people that, owing to the interruption by the whites, it was
          probable that the bones would not come to life at the end of four
          days, as predicted, but that he would make a new dance later and
          prove the efficacy of his creed.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then he started
          for the fort with his entire band of dancers, sixty-two in number,
          each with his "sacred medicine"—wheels, sticks, and drums. They
          journeyed afoot, stopping occasionally to dance, and reached the
          grounds of the fort late in the afternoon of the second day. On
          they passed, dancing in a spectacular manner, and camped that night
          on the flat a little above the fort, where they waited for someone
          to come over to interview them. The agent did not send for
          Nabakéltĭ that night, so at daybreak he started up White river with
          his band, passing by the present agency site, and crossing into
          Bear Springs valley. Thence they took the trail toward the Cibicu
          again, reaching the Carrizo in the evening, where they camped for
          the night and performed another dance. The following morning they
          took the trail for their home, which they reached rather early in
          the day.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As soon as the
          band had reached its destination, another summons was delivered to
          Nabakéltĭ to appear before the agent at the fort. This time the old
          man sent back word that he would not come: he had gone once, and if
          any had wished to see him, they had had their chance.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On receipt of
          this reply, sixty mounted soldiers, armed and provisioned, were
          sent over to the Cibicu to put a stop to the dancing. Apache scouts
          had been stationed to watch the manœuvres of the Indians and to
          keep the officials informed. They met the troopers, who made a
          night ride to the stream, and informed<span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page012">[pg 012]</span><a name="Pg012" id="Pg012" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> them where the old medicine-man was encamped.
          Early in the morning the soldiers reached the Cibicu at a point
          about two miles above Nabakéltĭ's camp, whence a detachment was
          despatched to arrest the medicine-man and bring him to the place
          where headquarters were being established. It was the intention
          merely to arrest and hold him while the troops rested for the day,
          preparatory to taking him back to the fort; but it was deemed
          necessary to send a force sufficiently large to cope with the
          Indians should they attempt resistance.</p><a name="fig22" id=

          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nabakéltĭ
          yielded without hesitation to the demands of the soldiers, and
          forthwith rode up to headquarters. Everything seemed very quiet.
          There was no demonstration against the soldiers, who stacked their
          arms and unloaded the pack-trains. The mules were hobbled and
          turned loose, and the cavalry horses tethered and fed.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While this
          apparently peaceful condition prevailed, a brother of the
          medicine-man, angered because of the arrest, dashed into camp on a
          pony and shot and killed the captain in command. Instantly, hardly
          realizing whence the shot had come, one of the troopers struck
          Nabakéltĭ on the head with a cudgel, killing him. Assured that a
          fight was imminent, the soldiers receded to higher ground, a short
          distance back, where they hurriedly made preparations for
          defence.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On learning that
          Nabakéltĭ had been killed, and deeming the soldiers wholly to
          blame, a small party of Apache attacked the troopers while
          retreating to the higher ground. Six of the soldiers were killed,
          the mules stampeded, and the provisions burned, all within a short
          space of time. The hostiles made their escape, practically all of
          them leaving the valley.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Government
          probably never lost money faster in an Indian campaign than it did
          as a result of its interference with Nabakéltĭ's harmless medicine
          craze. Had he been left alone his inevitable failure, already at
          hand, to bring the dead to life would have lost him his following,
          and in all probability his ill-success would have cost his life at
          the hands of one of his tribesmen. As it was, the hostilities that
          followed extended over several months, costing many lives and a
          vast sum of money.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The present
          Apache population is approximately six thousand, including the
          Jicarillas and Mescaleros of New Mexico. It is doubtful if the
          number ever exceeded ten thousand. In population, therefore, the
          Apache seem almost too insignificant to have kept the other tribes
          of the vast Southwest, as well as two civilized nations, in
          constant dread for so long a period.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the present
          time the greater part of the Apache reside on the White Mountain
          reservation, Arizona, comprising more than 3,500,000 acres, with
          agency headquarters at Whiteriver and San Carlos. This reservation
          is a part of the great tableland of southeastern Arizona, being a
          succession of mountains and high, park-like mesas, broken here and
          there with valleys and watered by limpid streams. The highlands are
          wooded with pine, cedar, fir, juniper, oak, and other trees, while
          in the valleys are mistletoe-laden cottonwood as well as willow,
          alder, and walnut, which, with smaller growths, are interwoven with
          vines of grape, hop, and columbine, in places forming a veritable
          jungle. On every hand, whether on mountain or in valley, many
          varieties of cactus grow in profusion; and in springtime cañon and
          vale, mountain-side and mesa, are all aglow with wild flowers.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In midsummer the
          temperature of the lower reaches seems as great as that of a
          furnace. At the same season in the mountain and high mesa country,
          especially in the shade of the beautiful forests, the atmosphere is
          ideal; but in winter these higher levels are covered deep with
          snow, swept by fierce winds that chill one to the very marrow.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The typical
          Apache habitation, called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">kówa</span></span>, consists of a framework of
          poles loosely thatched with native grass, through which the smoke
          from the central fire finds its outlet and the rain and snow sift
          in, rendering it anything but a comfortable shelter in time of
          storm. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">kówa</span></span> is erected by the women,
          who are little more than drudges, and as an Apache may
          have<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page014">[pg 014]</span><a name=

          feels able to support, he may have as many homes as circumstances
          require. The various wives are prone to be quarrelsome among
          themselves, for which reason a man usually maintains one wife on
          one part of the reservation and another wife perhaps many miles
          away.</p><a name="fig25" id="fig25"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the good old
          days the radius of Apache wandering centred in the mountains of
          what is now southeastern Arizona; this was their stronghold, their
          lair, whence they raided to the south, well down into Sonora and
          Chihuahua, westward to the Colorado river, northward into the Hopi
          and Navaho country, and eastward as far at least as western Texas.
          From this mountain rendezvous they swept down upon the Mexicans and
          Indians of Sonora and Chihuahua, and on the Pueblo villages of the
          north, while in later years they terrorized the white settlers of
          the entire Southwest. To follow them was a fruitless task which
          often led to the destruction of the pursuers.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The primitive
          Apache was a true nomad, a wandering child of Nature, whose
          birthright was a craving for the warpath, with courage and
          endurance probably exceeded by no other people, and with cunning
          beyond reckoning. Although his character is a strong mixture of
          courage and ferocity, the Apache is gentle and affectionate toward
          those of his own flesh and blood, particularly his children. Fear,
          to him, is unknown. Death he faces with stolid indifference; yet
          Apache men have been known to grieve so deeply over the loss of a
          friend as to end their troubles by self-destruction.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">No people could
          be better fitted than the Apache to conduct continuous predatory
          warfare. Every form of plant and animal life pays him tribute. An
          entirely naked Indian, without implements of any sort, would stop
          on a mountain slope and in a few minutes be sitting by a cheerful
          fire preparing a welcome meal. With a fragment of stone he would
          shape fire-sticks from the dead stalk of a yucca. Sitting with the
          flattened piece held firmly by his feet, a pinch of sand at the
          point of contact between the two sticks, with a few deft whirls of
          the round stick over his improvised hearth the lone traveller would
          soon have a fire kindled.<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page015">[pg
          015]</span><a name="Pg015" id="Pg015" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          Into the blaze he would cast a few sections of green, juicy
          mescal<a id="noteref_1" name="noteref_1" href=
          "#note_1"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1</span></span></a> stalk
          which, when cooked, would afford him both food and drink. This part
          of his meal finished, the Apache might gather other dead yucca
          stalks, split them, and often find within small stores of
          honey.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Many plants
          furnish small seeds rich in nutriment. These are gathered in a
          basket, ground on a metate, and the oily mass formed into a ball
          with the hands. The Apache assert that a lump as large as one's two
          fists would subsist a man for two days; but in addition he would
          eat wild greens of various kinds, either cooked or raw. One of the
          principal vegetal foods of the Apache is the mescal—in their
          language, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">náta</span></span>. Nothing can give a better
          idea of the economic life of these people than a description of one
          of their annual mescal harvests.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The mescal
          harvest occurs in the season of new life and growth, when the call
          from the wild is strong in the blood, and like a class of
          children—for they are but grown-up children—they pour out into the
          wilds. From the camp where they have passed the winter they take to
          the trails which lead to the mescal hills.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For some hours
          after leaving the huts on White river the path leads across the
          hot, dusty desert; then it reaches the rim of White river cañon and
          follows its edge so closely that a pebble tossed from the saddle
          would drop into the torrent more than a thousand feet below. How
          musical the roar of the stream, and how cool its waters look! As
          the trail passes some especially dizzy spot the Indian women lean
          away from the sheer edge in fear. For miles the trail traverses the
          bluff. At times the river is out of sight and hearing, then it
          emerges again and both eye and ear receive its greeting. At the
          hour when the piñon trees stretch their long shadows across the
          land the Indians urge their horses down a steep, winding trail and
          arrive at the river's bank. Here they ford, follow the course of
          the stream for a while, and then at a bend reach an open flat
          dotted here and there with<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page016">[pg

          shapely live-oaks. In this park-like opening the long straggling
          line comes to a halt.</p><a name="fig26" id="fig26"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All the worldly
          possessions of the Apache woman are packed on the horse which she
          and her children have ridden. The mother, with the youngest in her
          arms, first clambers down, followed by the little girl four years
          of age; she then removes the blankets that cover the pack, then the
          burden basket containing her cooking utensils, next the water
          bottle, and from across the saddle seat the large rawhide carryall
          that contains the family supplies and extra clothing. A smaller
          rawhide bag holds those little essentials necessary to the comfort
          of the family. The unloading finished, the woman fills the water
          bottle at the stream and gathers fuel for preparing the simple
          meal, which is soon over. If anything is more simple than the
          cooking it is the preparation of the bed. A small circular spot is
          cleared and an armful of grass, if any exists, is spread over it;
          the blankets are laid on the grass, and the bed is made. The
          blankets may not be clean, and certainly the pallet is not downy,
          but this matters little to a people inured to hardship; they are
          happy.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With a laugh the
          children tumble upon the blankets. Being dressed in a single
          garment a little girl innocently exposes more of her body than
          meets with her modest mother's approval. The scolding is full and
          positive. Little Miss Apache, sitting in the middle of the blanket
          with her knees drawn to her chin and with scant skirt now tucked
          carefully about her feet, looks up with roguish smile, then down at
          her wiggling toes in coquettish defiance.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From far down
          the stream resound the splash of water and the merry laughter of
          matrons and maidens bathing in the clear pools, and from above the
          more boisterous shouts of men and boys. Surely he who says the
          American Indian is morose, stolid, and devoid of humor never knew
          him in the intimacy of his own home.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With the coming
          of light the women are at work building the campfires, and the
          rising sun finds them at their morning meal. The breaking of camp
          is a brief task. To-day they are to<span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page017">[pg 017]</span><a name="Pg017" id="Pg017" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> cross the divide, ford Black river, and
          continue on to the mountains where the mescal grows abundantly.
          Travel in the cool morning hours is a delight, and seven o'clock
          finds the party well on its way. The long cavalcade winds slowly
          over the mountain trail. Just ahead is a mother with two children,
          a little girl astride behind her and a two-year-old boy standing in
          her lap. The mourning dove sounds its melancholy note from the
          forest, and the children take up the call. The little boy is not
          very proficient in the imitation, and sister corrects him time
          after time. Truly, in Indian-land, nature study begins early in
          life.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is
          noticeable change in the vegetation. The giant yuccas appear almost
          as a forest to-day; yesterday there was none. Soon the party gains
          the summit of the range, before which winds the valley of the Black
          with miles of placid stream in view. Quite different is this from
          White river, which is ever hurrying, rushing along. The Black flows
          within its grassy banks for long distances with scarcely a ripple;
          then a whirling rapid is passed, beyond which glides another long
          stretch of almost silent water.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">However, mescal
          does not grow by cool streams, and the trail again leads up into
          high mountains. On a broad slope well toward the summit the final
          halt is made. Close by is the mescal pit, perhaps twenty feet in
          diameter and three feet deep; it may have been used a hundred years
          or a thousand, abandoned for a long period, and then brought into
          use again. Each time it is employed it must first be cleaned of the
          refuse from the last burning; this done, a large supply of fuel is
          gathered and thrown in, and over all are piled great quantities of
          stones.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then begins the
          harvest of the mescal. With baskets on their backs the women go out
          to gather the plants. Their implements consist of a stick about two
          inches in diameter and three feet long, wedge-shaped and sharpened
          at one end, and a broad hatchet-like knife. On reaching a plant,
          the woman places the sharp end of the stick at its base and by a
          blow with a stone severs the root and pries it up. Nothing could be
          more primitive. The women of the Stone Age who gathered mescal on
          the same ground, and perhaps used the same pit, thus far must have
          used identical tools.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page018">[pg

          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the plant
          is cut from its root it is turned over and trimmed. For the latter
          the women employ the hatchet-like knife, cutting off the outer ends
          of the leaves. The plant now resembles a large head of cabbage and
          weighs from five to twenty pounds. As fast as the plants are cut
          the women place them in the burden baskets and carry them to the
          pit, load after load. To make it possible for each woman to
          identify her mescal after the cooking, each piece is branded with a
          distinguishing device—a property mark. The gathering of the mescal
          continues for several days, an area covering a radius of perhaps
          two miles being stripped of its budding plants, for such only are
          harvested.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The pit being
          ready and the mescal gathered, the work of cooking commences. Just
          at daylight the old woman in charge takes her place at the rim of
          the pit and prays that the cooking may be successful and that the
          people may be in condition to partake of the food. In igniting the
          fuel the old-fashioned fire-sticks must be employed; to use matches
          would bring ill fortune. When the fuel in the pit becomes a blazing
          mass the women go to prepare breakfast, but are soon at work again
          gathering brush and grass to cover the mescal. Within four hours
          the fuel is entirely consumed and the red-hot stones have settled
          to the bottom of the pit. When it is certain that no fuel remains
          unburned, as even a small amount of smoke would spoil the quality
          of the mescal, the head-woman says, "It is good," and with great
          eagerness her followers begin to fill the pit. There is need for
          haste in throwing in and covering the mescal, as the steam must be
          confined to prevent the hot stones from scorching it. The covering
          consists of alternate layers of green brush, grass, dry leaves, and
          finally a layer of earth, about six inches in thickness. After
          forty-eight hours of steaming the seething mass is uncovered and
          each woman removes her portion.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The greater part
          of the product of this cooking is now to be prepared for winter use
          by pulling the leaves apart and pounding them into pulp. This can
          be kneaded and handled much the same as dough, and while in this
          plastic state is formed into<span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          "tei tei-anchor"></a> large cakes two inches thick and perhaps
          three feet long. These are dried in the sun, when they have all the
          appearance of large slabs of India rubber, and are easily packed on
          horses for the homeward journey.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This dried
          mescal may be eaten without further preparation, but it is
          generally made into a gruel by mixing with water. Alone it is very
          sweet, and berries of the aromatic sumac, and frequently walnuts,
          are crushed with it to give it flavor.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The fruit of the
          opuntia, or prickly-pear cactus, which the Apache call <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">hush</span></span>,
          is much used for food both in its fresh state and dried. It is
          picked from the plant with pincers of split sticks. When the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">tú̆tza</span></span>, or burden basket, is
          filled its contents are poured on the ground and the fruit is
          brushed about with a small grass besom until the spines are worn
          off. In preparing <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">hush</span></span> the women grind seeds and
          pulp into a mass, thus retaining the full food value of the
          fruit.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Manzanita, piñon
          nuts, juniper berries, acorns of the scrub oak, fruit of the yucca,
          wild potatoes, wild onions, mesquite pods, and many varieties of
          fungi also furnish food. As a drink the Apache make a tea from the
          green or dried inner bark of the piñon.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The intoxicant
          and curse of their lives is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">tizwin</span></span>
          as it is sometimes called. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Túlapai</span></span> means "muddy or gray
          water." It is, in fact, a yeast beer. In preparing it corn is first
          soaked in water. If it be winter time the wet corn is placed under
          a sleeping blanket until the warmth of the body causes it to
          sprout; if summer, it is deposited in a shallow hole, covered with
          a wet blanket, and left until the sprouts appear, when it is ground
          to pulp on a metate. Water and roots are added, and the mixture is
          boiled and strained to remove the coarser roots and sprouts. At
          this stage the liquid has the consistency of thin cream soup. It is
          now set aside for twenty-four hours to cool and ferment, when it is
          fit for drinking. As the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">túlapai</span></span> will spoil in twelve
          hours it must be drunk quickly. Used in moderation it is not a bad
          beverage, but by no means a pleasant one to the civilized palate.
          The Apache, however, knows no moderation in his<span class=

          fasts for a day and then drinks great quantities of it,—often a

          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">túlapai</span></span>, is made from the
          mescal—not from the sap, according to the Mexican method, but from
          the cooked plant, which is placed in a heated pit and left until
          fermentation begins. It is then ground, mixed with water, roots
          added, and the whole boiled and set aside to complete fermentation.
          The Indians say its taste is sharp, like whiskey. A small quantity
          readily produces intoxication.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of game foods
          the Apache has deer, antelope, and wild turkey, with quail, some
          water fowl, smaller birds, rabbits, and wood-rats. Fish and bear
          meat are strictly tabooed.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The graphic art
          of the Apache finds expression chiefly in ceremonial paintings on
          deerskin, and in basketry. Only rarely have they made pottery,
          their roving life requiring utensils of greater stability. Such
          earthenware as they did make was practically the same as that of
          the Navaho, mostly in the form of small cooking vessels. Usually
          the pictures are painted on the entire deerskin, but sometimes the
          skin is cut square, and at others ceremonial deerskin shirts are
          symbolically painted. Occasionally the Apache attempts to picture
          the myth characters literally; at other times only a symbolic
          representation of the character is made. In addition to the mythic
          personages, certain symbols are employed to represent the incident
          of the myth. These paintings are made under the instruction of a
          medicine-man and are a part of the medicine paraphernalia. On some
          skins the most sacred characters in Apache mythology are
          represented symbolically—Nayé̆nĕzganĭ, the War God; Tubadzĭschí̆nĭ,
          his younger brother; Kútĕrastan, the Creator of All;
          Stĕnátlĭhă<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "vertical-align: super">n</span></span>, the chief goddess. In fact
          the symbolism on an elaborately painted deerskin may cover every
          phase of Apache cosmology.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In their
          basketry the Apache women display great taste in form, and in their
          more superior work employ much symbolic decoration. Since the
          beginning of the present "messiah craze" all baskets display the
          sacred symbols believed to have been<span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page021">[pg 021]</span><a name="Pg021" id="Pg021" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> revealed to Das Lan by Chuganaái Skhĭn—a
          combination of the cross and the crescent. There are many baskets,
          made before this new religious wave swept over the tribe, into
          which the symbolism has since been woven.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The basket most
          used is the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">tú̆tza</span></span>, or burden basket,
          roughly and loosely woven, ornamented with circular lines as often
          painted on as woven in. Previous to a messiah craze, which had its
          origin with the Apache about 1901, the designs in these baskets
          were purely decorative, without attempt at symbolism; but now, by
          order of a crafty old medicine-man, every <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">tú̆tza</span></span>
          must display the combined cross and crescent.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">tus</span></span> is
          a water bottle, made invariably of withes of the aromatic sumac,
          loosely woven, and coated inside and out with piñon gum. To use
          material other than sumac would be considered very bad. In the
          Apache deluge myth the people, instructed by Stĕnátlĭhă<span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">n</span></span>,
          built a monster <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">tus</span></span> of piñon branches in which
          they floated away.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">tsa-naskú̆dĭ</span></span> is a bowl or
          tray-shaped basket of splendid form, with symbolic decoration of
          intricate pattern.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The most
          pretentious basket is the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">tus-naskú̆dĭ</span></span>, in general form
          like the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">tus</span></span>, but much larger; it is used
          for the storage of grain. Its lines are most beautiful, as are also
          its inwoven symbolic designs.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Owing to the
          extremely secretive nature of the Apache, it is difficult for the
          casual student to learn anything of the relations between their
          mythology and the designs used in their basketry. Questioned, they
          will perhaps say, "We don't know," or "To make it look pretty." But
          an intelligent and trustworthy interpreter will tell you, "That
          woman knows, but she will not tell." A law of the cult brought
          about by the recent messiah religion is that every woman must have
          in readiness for use during the migration to the future world a
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The clan and
          gentile systems of the American Indians have been the bulwark of
          their social structure, for by preventing intermarriage within the
          clan or the gens the blood was kept at its<span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page022">[pg 022]</span><a name="Pg022" id="Pg022" class=

          Indian life, which resulted in the survival only of the fittest and
          provided the foundation for a sturdy people. But with advancing
          civilization one foresees the inevitable disintegration of their
          tribal laws, and a consequent weakening of the entire social
          structure, for the Indians seem to have absorbed all the evil, and
          to have embodied little of the good, that civilized life
          teaches.</p><a name="fig29" id="fig29"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Coyoteros
          are divided into five bands, each consisting of a number of clans,
          although in one band there are now survivors of a single clan only,
          while in others as many as seven or eight clans are still to be
          found. Descent among the Apache generally is reckoned through the
          mother; that is, the children belong to their mother's clan. An
          exception to this rule is said by "Peaches," an old Apache scout
          under Crook, to exist among the Chiricahua, where the children take
          the gens of the father. Among the Apache some of the younger
          generation are inclined to disregard tribal laws respecting
          marriage, but in former times they were rigidly enforced, marriage
          within the clan or the gens being regarded as incestuous. When
          asked what would happen if a man and a woman belonging to the same
          clan should marry, one old man answered that both would be quickly
          put to death.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the Appendix
          are given the clan names of the Coyoteros, also of the Arivaipa and
          the Chiricahua. Geronimo, Chato, and Cochise were members of the
          Aiahá<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "vertical-align: super">n</span></span>, People of the East, clan.
          Most of the clan names are derived from localities in which the
          ancestors of the clan are supposed to have first lived.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With the Apache,
          as with other tribes, the clan organization has an important
          bearing on property right. Regardless of what property either
          spouse may hold or own at the time of marriage, the other
          immediately becomes possessed of his or her moiety. Should the wife
          die, her husband retains possession of the property held in common
          so long as he does not remarry, but what might be termed the legal
          ownership of the wife's half interest becomes vested in her clan.
          Should he attempt to dissipate the property the members of the
          deceased wife's clan would at once interfere.<span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page023">[pg 023]</span><a name="Pg023" id="Pg023"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> If the widower wishes to marry again
          and the woman of his choice belongs to the clan of his former wife,
          then he and the new wife become owners in common of all personal
          property held by him; but if the second wife belongs to a different
          clan from that of the former wife, then the husband must make
          actual transfer of half of the common property to the clanspeople
          of the deceased woman, who inherited the legal interest in it at
          their relative's death. The same tribal law applies in the case of
          a widow.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Much internal
          strife naturally results whenever an actual distribution of
          property is made. In the first place the surviving spouse
          unwillingly relinquishes the moiety of the property to the
          relatives of the deceased, and the immediate relatives often
          disagree with the remainder of the clan. In former times death of
          one or more members of contending clans often resulted when the
          division of much property was made. Having no tribunal for making
          an equitable division, the matter was left to mutual agreement,
          resulting in disputes and frequently murder.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With the
          breaking up of the clans, together with the rapid disintegration of
          ancient customs and laws, this property law is fast becoming
          forgotten; but so recently as 1906 such disputes as those mentioned
          occurred under both the Fort Apache and San Carlos agencies,
          creating no little ill-feeling. In one instance a man refused to
          deliver possession of half of his little herd of horses to his
          deceased wife's clanspeople when contemplating marriage with
          another woman, and appealed to the missionaries for aid. He was
          compelled to make the division, however, before he could
          remarry.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Kútĕrastan, as
          if waking from a long sleep, sat up and rubbed his face and eyes
          with both hands. Then bending forward, he looked up into the
          endless darkness, and lo! light appeared everywhere above him. He
          then looked down, and all below became a sea of light. A glance to
          the east created yellow streaks of dawn, another to the west the
          saffron tints of the dying day, both soon becoming obscured by
          numerous clouds of many hues, formed by his looking around and
          about in all directions.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again with both
          hands Kútĕrastan wiped his eyes and sweating face and, rubbing his
          hands together as if he were rolling a small pebble between the
          palms, suddenly parted them with a quick downward fling, and there
          before him on a shining, vaporless, mirage-like cloud sat a little
          girl no larger than a doll. Kútĕrastan directed her to stand up,
          asking where she intended to go, but she replied not. He cleared
          his vision once more with his hands, then proffered his right hand
          to the girl, Stĕnátlĭhă<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "vertical-align: super">n</span></span>, Woman Without Parents, who
          grasped it, with the greeting "Whence came you?"</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For reply
          Kútĕrastan merely repeated her question, adding, "Look to the east,
          it is light! There will be light in the south, in the west, and in
          the north." And as she looked she saw light. He then came out upon
          the cloud.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"Where is the
          earth?" asked Stĕnátlĭhă<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "vertical-align: super">n</span></span>, to which Kútĕrastan
          replied by asking:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"Where is the
          sky?" Then requesting that he be not disturbed, he began to sing:
          "I am thinking, thinking, thinking, thinking what shall I do next."
          Four times he thus sang, at the end of the fourth time brushing his
          face with his hands, which he rubbed briskly together and parted
          quickly; and there before him stood Chuganaái, the Sun. Raising his
          left hand to his brow, from the sweat thereon, which he rolled in
          his hands as before, Kútĕrastan let drop from his right palm a
          small boy, Hádĭntĭn Skhĭn.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page025">[pg 025]</span><a name="Pg025" id="Pg025" class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The four sat
          upon that still cloud for a time as if in reverie, the first to
          break the silence being he who commenced the creation: "What shall
          we do next? I do not like this cloud to live upon, but we are to
          rule and must stay together. How dreary it is here! I wish we had
          some place to go." And then he set to work again, creating
          Nacholécho, the Tarantula, who was later to help in completing the
          earth, and Nôkusé, the Big Dipper, whose duty it would be to
          befriend and to guide. The creation of Nĭlchídĭlhkĭzn, the Wind,
          Ndídĭlhkĭzn, the Lightning Maker, and the clouds in the west to
          house Ndísâgocha<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "vertical-align: super">n</span></span>, Lightning Rumbler, whom he
          placed in them at the same time, next occupied his attention. Then
          turning to Stĕnátlĭhă<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "vertical-align: super">n</span></span>, Kútĕrastan said, "Truly
          this is not a fit place in which to live; let us make the earth."
          And so saying he at once began to sing, "I am thinking of the
          earth, the earth, the earth; I am thinking of the earth," which he
          repeated four times. As he ceased, Stĕnátlĭhă<span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">n</span></span>,
          Chuganaái, and Hádĭntĭn Skhĭn each shook hands with him. Sweat from
          their hands adhered to his. He at once began rubbing his palms,
          when suddenly there slipped from between them a small brown body,
          no larger than a bean. Kútĕrastan kicked it and it expanded;
          Stĕnátlĭhă<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "vertical-align: super">n</span></span> then kicked it and its size
          further increased; Chuganaái next gave it a severe blow with his
          foot and it became larger still; a kick from Hádĭntĭn Skhĭn made it
          greater yet. Nĭlchídĭlhkĭzn, the Wind, was told to go inside and
          blow outward in all directions. This he did, greatly expanding the
          dimensions of that body, now so wide that they could hardly see its
          edge. The Lightning was next directed to exert his strength, so
          with a terrific flash and roar he penetrated the body to its
          centre, spreading it still wider. Then Tarantula was called on to
          assist, and accordingly he started off to the east, spinning a
          strong black cord, on which he pulled with all his might; another
          cord of blue was spun out to the south, a third of yellow to the
          west, and a fourth of glistening white to the north. A mighty pull
          on each of these stretched the surface of that dark brown body to
          almost immeasurable size. Finally Kútĕrastan directed all to cover
          their eyes with their hands, and when they<span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page026">[pg 026]</span><a name="Pg026" id="Pg026" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> opened them a moment later they beheld
          Nigostú̆n, the Earth, complete in extent. No hills or mountains
          were there in sight, nothing but a smooth, treeless, reddish-brown
          plain.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nĭlchídĭlhkĭzn,
          the Wind, scratched his chest and rubbed his fingers together, when
          out from between them flew Dátĭlyĕ, the Humming-bird. Dátĭlyĕ was
          told to make a circuit of the earth and report what he saw. He
          started off toward the east, circled south, west, north, and back
          from the east. All was well; the earth was most beautiful, very
          smooth, and covered with water on the western side.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the Earth
          was not still; it kept shifting and rolling and dancing up and
          down, so Kútĕrastan made four great posts—colored black, blue,
          yellow, and white—to support it. Then he directed
          Stĕnátlĭhă<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "vertical-align: super">n</span></span> to sing a song. She sang,
          "The world is made and will soon sit still." These two then stood
          and faced Chuganaái and Hádĭntĭn Skhĭn, when into their midst came
          Nĭlchídĭlhkĭzn, who dashed away to the cardinal points with the
          four posts, which he placed under the sides of the earth; and upon
          them it sat and was still. This pleased Kútĕrastan, so he sang a
          song, repeating, "The world is now made and sits still."</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then Kútĕrastan
          began another song, referring to the sky. None existed as yet, and
          he felt there ought to be one. Four times he chanted the song, at
          the end of the fourth time spreading his hands wide before him,
          when lo! there stood twenty-eight men and women ready to help make
          a sky to cover the earth. He next chanted a song for the purpose of
          making chiefs for the sky and the earth, and at its close sent
          Ndídĭlhkĭzn, the Lightning Maker, to encircle the world.
          Ndídĭlhkĭzn departed at once, but returned in a short time with
          three very uncouth persons, two girls and a boy, whom he had found
          in the sky in a large turquoise bowl. Not one of them had eyes,
          ears, hair, mouth, nose, or teeth, and though they had arms and
          legs, they had neither fingers nor toes.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Chuganaái at
          once sent for Doh, the Fly, to come and erect a <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">kaché̆</span></span>,
          or sweat-house. It took but a short time to put up the<span class=

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> framework, which Stĕnátlĭhă<span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">n</span></span>
          covered closely with four heavy clouds: a black cloud on the east,
          a blue one on the south, a yellow one on the west, and a white one
          on the north. Out in front of the doorway, at the east, she spread
          a soft red cloud for a foot-blanket after the sweat. Twelve stones
          were heated in a fire, and four of them placed in the <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">kaché̆</span></span>.
          Kútĕrastan, Stĕnátlĭhă<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "vertical-align: super">n</span></span>, Chuganaái, and Hádĭntĭn
          Skhĭn each inspected the sweat-house and pronounced it well made.
          The three newcomers were bidden to enter and were followed by
          Chuganaái, Nĭlchídĭlhkĭzn, Ndídĭlhkĭzn, Nôkusé, and Doh. The eight
          sang songs as their sweat began. Chuganaái led, singing four songs,
          and each of the others followed in turn with the same number. They
          had had a good sweat by the time the songs were finished, so
          Stĕnátlĭhă<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "vertical-align: super">n</span></span> removed the black cloud and
          all came out. She then placed the three strangers on the red-cloud
          blanket, and under the direction of Kútĕrastan made for them
          fingers, toes, mouth, eyes, ears, hair, and nose. Then Kútĕrastan
          bade them welcome, making the boy, whom he called Yádĭlhkĭh Skhĭn,
          Sky Boy, chief of the sky and its people. The second he named
          Nigostú̆n Nalí̆n, Earth Daughter, and placed her in charge of the
          earth and its crops; while to the third, Hádĭnĭn Nalí̆n, Pollen
          Girl, was assigned the care of the health of the earth's people.
          This duty also devolved upon Hádĭntĭn Skhĭn, but each looks more to
          the welfare of his own sex than to that of the other.</p><a name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The earth was
          smooth, flat, and barren, so Kútĕrastan made a few animals, birds,
          trees, and a hill. Then he sent Ágocho, the Pigeon, to see how the
          world looked. Four days later Ágocho returned and said all was
          beautiful, but that in four days more the water on the opposite
          side would rise and flood the land. Kútĕrastan at once created a
          piñon tree. This Stĕnátlĭhă<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "vertical-align: super">n</span></span> skilfully tended until it
          grew to be of gigantic size at the end of four days. Then with four
          great limbs as a framework she made a very large water bottle,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">tus</span></span>, covering it with gum from
          the piñon. When the water appeared as predicted, Kútĕrastan went up
          on a cloud, taking his twenty-eight helpers with him, while
          Stĕnátlĭhă<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The flood
          completely submerged the earth for twelve days. Then the waters
          subsided, leaving the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">tus</span></span> on the summit of the hill
          Kútĕrastan had made. The rush of the waters had changed the once
          smooth, level plain into series of mountains, hills, rivers, and
          valleys, so that Stĕnátlĭhă<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "vertical-align: super">n</span></span> hardly knew where they were
          when she opened the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">tus</span></span> and came out. Tázhĭ, the
          Turkey, and Gấgĕ, the Crow, were the first to make a tour of the
          land. At the base of the hill they descended into a small muddy
          alkaline creek, in which the Turkey got the tips of his
          tail-feathers whitened, and they have been white ever since. On
          return they reported that all looked beautiful as far as they had
          travelled. Stĕnátlĭhă<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "vertical-align: super">n</span></span> then sent Ágocho to make a
          complete circuit and let her know how things appeared on all sides.
          He came back much elated, for he had seen trees, grass, mountains,
          and beautiful lakes and rivers in every direction.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Directing the
          others to remain where she left them, Stĕnátlĭhă<span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">n</span></span>
          summoned Hádĭntĭn Skhĭn, Hádĭntĭn Naln, Ndídĭlhkĭzn, and Ágocho,
          and took them up in a cloud, in which they drifted until they met
          Kútĕrastan and his band of workers, who had completed the sky
          during the time of the flood. The two clouds floated to the top of
          the hill on which stood the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">tus</span></span>. All descended to the valley
          below, where Stĕnátlĭhă<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "vertical-align: super">n</span></span> marshalled them into line,
          that Kútĕrastan might talk to them. He briefly told them that he
          was going to leave them and wished each one to do his part toward
          making the world perfect and happy. "You, Ndísâgocha<span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">n</span></span>,
          shall have charge of the clouds and the water. You, Yádĭlhkĭh
          Skhĭn, I leave in charge of the sky. Nigostú̆n Nalí̆n, you are to
          look after the crops of our people; and you, Hádĭntĭn Skhĭn, must
          care for their health and guide them." He then called
          Stĕnátlĭhă<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "vertical-align: super">n</span></span> to him and placed her in
          charge of all.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The people stood
          in line facing their god, with hands extended as if in
          supplication. Kútĕrastan and Stĕnátlĭhă<span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">n</span></span>
          stood facing each other. Each rubbed their thighs with their hands,
          then cast their hands downward, and there arose between them
          a<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page029">[pg 029]</span><a name=
          "Pg029" id="Pg029" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> great pile of wood.
          Stĕnátlĭhă<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "vertical-align: super">n</span></span> knelt and slipped a hand
          under it, and as she did so Kútĕrastan passed his hand over the
          top. Great white billowy clouds of smoke at once issued forth,
          rising straight skyward. Into these Kútĕrastan disappeared. All the
          other gods and goddesses soon followed, leaving the twenty-eight
          whom Kútĕrastan had made to build the sky to remain upon the earth
          and people it. Chuganaái went east to travel with the sun;
          Stĕnátlĭhă<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "vertical-align: super">n</span></span> departed westward to make
          her home in clouds on the horizon, while Hádĭntĭn Skhĭn and
          Hádĭntí̆n Nalín sought homes among the clouds in the south, and
          Nôkusé may still be seen in the northern sky at night.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Apache is
          inherently devoutly religious; his life is completely moulded by
          his religious beliefs. From his morning prayer to the rising sun,
          through the hours, the days, and months—throughout life
          itself—every act has some religious significance. Animals,
          elements, every observable thing of the solar system, all natural
          phenomena, are deified and revered. Like all primitive people, not
          understanding the laws of nature, the Apache ascribe to the
          supernatural all things passing their understanding. The
          medicine-men consider disease evil, hence why try to treat evil
          with drugs? Disease is of divine origin, so to the beneficent and
          healing gods the Apache naturally make supplication for cure.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Apache, even
          if willing, could not directly impart their religious beliefs or
          their philosophy. It is only by study of their myths, myth songs,
          and medicine practices, and by close observance of their life, that
          a comprehensive idea of such beliefs can be gained.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A concise
          outline of the mythology of the Apache is given in the following

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A—The nucleus of
          the universe, called Chalhké̆lh Nalíín, Night Girl. In the
          beginning it was merely a spot of color in which, during the course
          of time, a form appeared, and later emerged. This was Kútĕrastan,
          the Creator.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">B—Kútĕrastan,
          the Creator of All, is standing on the clouds, his first home,
          holding lightning in each hand. To his left is the <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">tus</span></span>, or
          water bottle, in which the people of the earth took refuge from the
          flood shortly after their creation. Above him are four clouds,
          those into which he departed when leaving the earth for his
          celestial abode. He first created several assistants, who in turn
          created others by rubbing sweat and small particles of cuticle from
          the face and body.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
          C—Stĕnátlĭhă<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          helper of Kútĕrastan, is seen standing on the clouds. In her right
          hand is a piñon tree, from the branches and gum of which the large
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">tus</span></span> was made at the time of the
          deluge. Above her flies Dátĭlyĕ, the Humming-bird, who was sent as
          a messenger about the world to note how its creation
          progressed.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">D—Chuganaái
          Skhĭn was the second person created by Kútĕrastan. He followed
          Stĕnátlĭhă<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "vertical-align: super">n</span></span>, and is therefore third in
          importance of the many deities. Not only does he give light to the
          day, but he has the power to relieve and cure disease with the aid
          of the first beams of his morning light. The Apache ask his
          blessing before sunrise, generally imploring his beneficence "as
          soon as you look upon me." The serrated circles typify the abodes
          of these gods, which are protected by insurmountable barriers.</p>

          messengers of the gods. They are supposed to communicate with the
          medicine-men, bringing to them words of wisdom from the several
          gods as they sit and chant in ceremony, or when they are fasting.
          Their name, Nigostú̆n Bĭká Bĭnálzĕ, Earth Messengers, indicates

          symbolize spirits of the air who reveal to the medicine-men the

          made to them in visions as they sit and drum and sing when
          endeavoring to discover some new cure for an affliction, or to
          initiate new customs that might be pleasing to the gods. The
          priests often take a medicine skin of this sort and go out into the
          mountains, where they fast and sing over it for hours at a time,
          awaiting the coming of the spirits.</p>

          indicate communication from one god to another.</p>

          who was made to conceive by the sun's rays as she lay asleep on the
          eastern slope of a mountain. He is the War God and miracle
          performer, the culture hero who in parallel legends appears in many
          North American aboriginal cults. Great monsters in the form of
          giant antelopes, rolling stones, and beasts of hideous conception
          are supposed to have inhabited the earth for a time, destroying its
          people. These monsters typify only the evils of this life; in fact
          death itself is spoken of in many legends as one of the monsters,
          in such form engaging in a long discussion with the miracle
          performer to prove that he should not be destroyed; if he were, the
          earth would become overpopulated. With his bow and arrow and
          turquoise lance Nayé̆nĕzganĭ banished these curses from earth. He

          had killed them all, he and his younger brother, Tubadzĭschí̆nĭ,
          quarrelled. The Bluebird revealed to the latter the spot where
          Nayé̆nĕzganĭ kept his veins buried, so he sought them out and shot
          arrows into them, thus killing him. Other myths relate how
          Nayé̆nĕzganĭ was later resurrected, and he is still prayed to as

          Nalí̆n, one of the most venerated and greatly feared personages in
          the Apache mythology. She is the Goddess of Death, or rather of the
          after-life, for she controls all souls that pass on to the future
          world. The road to this afterworld is supposed to cross her
          shoulders and is symbolized by the Milky Way, a trail made by the
          departing spirits. The Apache will not utter the name of a deceased
          person, because they say the dead have gone on to Yólkai Nalí̆n and
          are her people. If they talked of them it might anger her, and when
          their death ensues she might refuse them admittance to the eternal
          paradise. This goddess is supposed to preside over the birth of
          children, hence supplications and offerings are made to her
          immediately before childbirth. She is invoked at other times to
          withhold her call, for it is believed that she can cause death.
          These prayers are addressed to Yólkai Nalí̆n through the medium of
          small white shells and white stone beads. The white beads are
          symbolic of purity, and through them Yólkai Nalí̆n is asked to keep
          the minds of the people free from evil thoughts or deeds.</p>

          Nalí̆n, the Turquoise Girl, is the creator of all things green. She
          has to do with the crops in the fields, and the devout Apache prays
          to her every morning during the season of growth.</p>

          Dĭlhklí̆shĕn is the God of Intellect. He controls the minds of the
          people, making their thoughts good or evil at will. It was he who
          first talked to the people on earth. When a child is born its
          parents often pray that Kútĕrastan will make it grow to be like
          Ĕnásho Dĭlhklí̆shĕn, to whom prayers are addressed for aid when one
          must talk to the people. In such case no offering of pollen is made
          unless the request be presented to an image representing this god,
          when pollen is sprinkled upon it.</p>

          the nuts and fruits that grow wild, may be fructified early in the
          season, to insure good harvests.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          curing people stricken with bodily disease. Diseases of the body

          live in the four cardinal directions and are impersonated in
          medicine ceremonies by men wearing stick masks, who always take
          stations at the four sides of the patient. These doctors are not
          called in case of illness until after the four chief deities have
          been supplicated, when, as a last resort, the medicine-man prays to
          the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          cannot help, there is believed to be no hope for the patient. In

          of burden. The bear and the deer were the horses of that time. In
          the graphic representations of the Apache these four spirits are
          often pictured riding deer and bear.</p>

          medicine-men have some knowledge of the medicinal properties of
          plants and generally make use of them in the treatment of disease,
          but their treatment consists more of incantation than aught else.
          Even in collecting the plants they invoke the deities, usually
          facing the cardinal points in turn. In case the prescription calls
          for a combination of herbs or other vegetal products, the number
          four is always strictly adhered to; it might be a decoction made of
          four roots of one variety or of a single root from each of four
          varieties of plants.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Every Apache

          mythology. With his prayer wands he rehearses the symbolic figures,
          praying to the mythical characters who are regarded as most
          efficacious in the particular ailment under treatment. In his own
          little <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          painted deerskin spread before him, on which are delineated the
          symbolic representations of a score of gods comprising the Apache
          pantheon, a medicine-man will sit and croon songs and pray all day
          and all night in the hope of hearing the voices of celestial

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While this
          prayer is worded as if uttered by the supplicant, it is in reality
          offered by the medicine-man in his behalf.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There are head
          medicine-men and medicine-men of lesser degree. The man who becomes
          influential enough to be considered the head medicine-man of the
          tribe is more of a politician than a doctor of diseases, and in
          important cases only is he called to treat in a healing ceremony.
          It requires a particularly capable Indian to attain the position of
          head medicine-man, for to do so he must not only make the people
          subservient to his will, but must wrest the leadership from some
          other and usually older medicine-man who is himself an influential
          character. Unfortunately it is apt to be the most crafty, scheming
          man who gains such power over his tribesmen.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A case in point
          was the recent strife between Das Lan and Goshonné. For some years
          the latter, an Indian of exceptional ability and withal apparently
          an honest man in his treatment of diseases, was the head
          medicine-man of the White Mountain Apache. Then it came to pass
          that the crafty old Das Lan of the Cibicu had his vision, in which
          was revealed a special<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page038">[pg

          message brought by Chuganaái Skhĭn from Kútĕrastan to the Apache
          people. This was the beginning of the present so-called messiah
          craze.</p><a name="fig41" id="fig41"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From the first
          there was promise of a battle to the end between Goshonné and Das
          Lan. Goshonné well knew that if the new cult gained a firm footing
          he would lose his influence and at best be but a mediocre
          medicine-man. Das Lan, on the other hand, knew that he must break
          the power of such a man as Goshonné, if he was to assume the
          leadership. Goshonné scoffed and scorned, and would have none of
          the new belief. Still, he was an Indian, and the prophecies of his
          rival gradually filled him with superstitious fear, while his
          followers were either deserting him openly or were secretly joining
          the ranks of the enemy. Death was predicted for the members of
          Goshonné's own family, and well could Das Lan make such prophecies,
          for Goshonné's two brothers were already stricken with
          tuberculosis. First one died, then the other. Das Lan could now
          point to him and say, "That is what Kútĕrastan does to those who do
          not believe!" It was thus that Goshonné's power finally was broken
          and Das Lan became a seer.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Sacred pollen,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">hádĭntĭn</span></span>, is used in all
          ceremonies, particularly in those designed for healing. The
          principal source of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">hádĭntĭn</span></span> is the tule, but much
          of it comes from the piñon. For prayers invoking an abundance of
          corn, pollen is mixed with cornmeal. Not only do the medicine-men
          use this powder, but each individual carries a small quantity of it
          in a deerskin pouch somewhere about his person. In the pollen may
          be small medicine trinkets—sometimes consisting of a few shell
          beads from prehistoric ruins—and there is scarcely a person, old or
          young, who does not have a small section of the candle cactus
          fastened somewhere about his clothing.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When childbirth
          approaches, the medicine-men are always summoned. Nothing can give
          a better idea of the medicine rites on such an occasion, and of the
          use of sacred pollen, than a description of a maternity belt
          procured by the writer and here illustrated. So far as can be
          learned, this belt is very old, so old that its painted symbolic
          figures have been three times renewed. Belts<span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page039">[pg 039]</span><a name="Pg039" id="Pg039"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of this kind are very rare, and are
          hired whenever their use is required. The owner of this particular
          belt, a widow, did not care to dispose of it; as she expressed it,
          "it is like a husband": the remuneration from granting its use was
          sufficient to support her.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The belt is made
          from skin of the mountain lion, the black-tail deer, the white-tail
          deer, and the antelope—animals which give birth to their young
          without trouble. Medicine-men are called in to pray to the spirits
          of these animals when a woman approaching confinement puts on the
          belt. It is worn for a day or so only, but constantly during the
          critical period, not being removed until after the child is born.
          Prayers are made, first by a mother or father for their daughter,
          then by a medicine-man, and lastly by the patient to the gods and
          elements depicted on the belt. These figures are all connected with
          lightning lines. The first one to the left is
          Stĕnátlĭhă<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "vertical-align: super">n</span></span>; on the same portion is the
          Snake Girl, Klĭshcho Nalí̆n; the next is Nayé̆nĕzganĭ, the third
          Tubadzĭschí̆nĭ, and the last Yólkai Nalí̆n. The sharp points around
          the circular abodes of the two goddesses represent barricades for
          protection. At the real homes of these deities, none can pass
          through these barriers.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Each of the gods
          from left to right is prayed to successively, and <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">hádĭntĭn</span></span> is sprinkled around
          them afterward. Stĕnátlĭhă<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "vertical-align: super">n</span></span> is the first to be
          addressed by the prospective mother:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"We are your
          children. When you gave birth to your children, it caused you no
          trouble. Make me like yourself, that my child, soon to be born, may
          come into this world easily and quickly, without pain to me."</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Next the Snake
          Girl is prayed to:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"Klí̆shcho
          Nalí̆n, you came into this life with ease. Do what you can for me
          now, that my child may come in like manner."</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then to
          Nayé̆nĕzganĭ:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"Help my babe,
          soon to be born, to come as you did—quickly, easily, and without
          pain."</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The belt in
          Nayé̆nĕzganĭ's left hand represents the one worn by his mother,
          Stĕnátlĭhă<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          Tubadzĭschí̆nĭ, next pictured, to whom the woman addresses a prayer
          much the same as the last. The skirt also is the one worn by

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Yólkai Nalí̆n is
          the favorite goddess from whom, in their belief, the Apache women
          are endowed with great beneficence. She lives in the skies, where
          all souls go. The prayer to her is, as to the others, "Save me from
          pain and let my child come as you did."</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Clouds at the
          feet of Nayé̆nĕzganĭ typify the bounties of the world into which it
          is hoped and prayed the child will be happily born.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The prayers
          finished, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">hádĭntĭn</span></span> is sifted over all the
          figures. Beginning at the left, the lightning line is followed into
          Stĕnátlĭhă<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "vertical-align: super">n</span></span>'s abode, which is then
          encircled, and the sacred powder is liberally sprinkled around and
          over her body. Each figure is treated in like manner.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The accompanying
          plate shows a medicine-cap made by Yotlú̆nĭ, a medicine-man, about
          forty years ago, to cure a boy of lightning stroke which had
          impaired his reason, and a small wooden image of a god recently
          made to be carried by a girl troubled with nervousness. On both
          these objects the gods and elements which cause afflictions and
          which alone can give relief are symbolically represented.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The central
          figure on the cap pictures Ndídĭlhkĭzn, Lightning Maker, with
          lightning, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">hádĭlhkĭh</span></span>, in zigzag lines above
          his head and beneath his feet. The broad arch indicates clouds with
          rifts in them, out of which the evil came and into which it may
          return. The cross of abalone, the small white bead, and the eagle
          feather are media through which Tu Ntĕlh (Wide Water), Yólkai
          Nalí̆n (White-Shell Girl), and Itsád Ndé̆yu (Eagle People) are
          supplicated.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The cap was worn
          at night by the boy, whose parents each morning at sunrise prayed
          to the various gods and elements represented on it, invoking them
          to take back that which they<span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page041">[pg 041]</span><a name="Pg041" id="Pg041" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> had left with the boy, and adding: "Keep us
          even in temper and mild and clean in action. We do wrong at times,
          but that is not our wish. If our minds are kept clean we will do
          nothing bad. We wish to have good thoughts and to do good deeds.
          Keep our minds clear that we may think them and do them." After
          each prayer <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">hádĭnĭn</span></span> was sifted upon the
          symbol representing the deity addressed.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As the boy soon
          recovered, the virtue of the cap was attested, and subsequently its
          owner often hired it to others.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The little
          wooden image represents Hádĭnĭn Skhĭn, Pollen Boy, God of Health.
          The painted figures on the skin pouch in which it is carried are
          similar to those on the cap, and all are supplicated in the same
          manner. The medicine-man who made the image and pouch received a
          horse from the father of the patient in payment; but not the least
          interesting feature of the case for which these objects were made
          is that the god of the natives received all the credit for the
          efficient treatment given the afflicted girl for a year by the
          reservation physician.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Dry-paintings,
          or figures drawn upon the ground with colored earths, were used in
          the Apache healing ceremonies, but never to a great extent, and of
          late years they have been practically abandoned. These paintings,
          compared with the beautiful, conventional productions of the
          Navaho, are crude; in making them the Apache always attempt to
          picture the objects literally rather than to represent them
          conventionally or symbolically.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the
          infrequent occasions when the dry-paintings are employed, the
          medicine-man in charge of the ceremony directs his assistants, at
          daylight, to begin the painting. When it is finished he takes his
          station close to the easternmost figure of the painting, on its
          northern side. At the right of the medicine-man sit twelve chosen
          singers with a drum. The four masked <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">gáŭn</span></span>,
          or gods, at the same time take their places at the cardinal points.
          The patient then enters from the east and sits down on the head of
          the large figure in the centre of the dry-painting. As he does so
          the medicine-man commences to sing, and is joined by the chorus at
          once. They may sing the song four times, or sing four<span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page042">[pg 042]</span><a name="Pg042" id="Pg042"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> different songs, or any multiple of
          four, at the pleasure of the medicine-man. When the songs are
          finished the four masked personages scrape the colored earths into
          a heap about the patient and rub them in handfuls over his body. If
          this ceremony proves to be ineffectual, it is believed to be the
          will of the gods that the patient be not cured.</p><a name="fig43"

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among the
          Apache, in the spring of 1906, the excessive use of a combined
          cross and crescent symbol was noted. Men, women, and children had
          this anchor-like design cut into wood, tin, and metal talismans,
          and also tattooed on their faces and branded on their horses. It
          was used also as a decorative device in much of the new basketry
          and worked in beads on their moccasins, and new shirts and waists
          seldom failed to display a cross in narrow yellow and black ribbon
          in front.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Four years
          before this time a forceful old medicine-man living on the Cibicu,
          in a remote corner of the Apache reservation, either through the
          influence of a vision or other hallucination, or by a desire to
          become the ruling spirit in the tribe, proclaimed the gospel of a
          messiah who, he claimed, had appeared to him in the hills and would
          later return to the deliverance of his tribespeople.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In childhood
          this future prophet was given the name Das Lan, Hanging Up, by
          which designation he is commonly known in familiar discourse among
          his tribesmen; but on the census rolls of the White Mountain agency
          he is recorded simply as "V-9." On becoming a medicine-man in his
          youth, in accordance with tribal custom he adopted the name—what
          may be termed a professional title—Dó<span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">n</span></span>ĭ
          Tlí̆shĭ Nôĭltá<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "vertical-align: super">n</span></span>sh, which signifies
          Turquoise Rolling Stone.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As hitherto
          mentioned, the Apache is the personification of devoutness in the
          performance of his religious duties, and no matter where
          circumstances may place him, he manages always to<span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page043">[pg 043]</span><a name="Pg043" id="Pg043"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> have a small pouch of <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">hádĭntĭn</span></span> carefully secreted
          about his person for use in paying his devotions to half a score of
          gods, at least once every four days. If occasion demands, he may
          pray every day, or four times a day, or any multiple of four times.
          This custom has a direct bearing on the story of the messiah, which
          is this:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Das Lan, in a
          spirit of more than usual devotion, began a series of prayers to
          the gods of Life, Peace, and Plenty, delivered as usual just as the
          sun appeared over the eastern mountains. On the fourth morning,
          with offerings of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">hádĭntĭn</span></span>, he invoked the
          benediction of Kútĕrastan, the Creator, Hádĭntĭn Skhĭn, God of
          Health, Hádĭntĭn Nalín, Goddess of Crops, and of Chuganaái himself,
          the All-seeing Sun. As the fourth pinch of pollen wafted away on
          the breeze there appeared the vision, immediately beneath the sun,
          of a small bearded dwarf, less than three feet in height, who
          approached him, and said:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"I am a
          messenger sent by Kútĕrastan to talk to you. The Sun is my father;
          I have just left him to come to you. You are to inform all your
          people that a change is about to be made in their lives and in the
          nature of the whole world. In place of this life of strife and toil
          with little to eat, all, the white man as well as the Indian, will
          be taken to a place where all things grow without labor, and where
          there will be no rough, barren mountains, but instead broad valleys
          filled with grass, trees, corn, fruits, nuts, and all kinds of game
          in abundance. There, too, you will meet all your fathers and
          mothers and brothers and sisters and children who have gone before
          you from their homes, for they are now there. There no sickness or
          death will visit anyone. The old and feeble will become strong, the
          crooked straight, and the blind shall see. But to be taken, all
          must have faith, believing as one, and observe these instructions I
          am to leave with you. You are commissioned to instruct the people.
          Those who believe must adopt the <span class=

          faith, for it represents the shape the new world will have and the
          road all must travel to reach it, and any who start on the journey
          without using this sign will be<span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          depart, I will return to lead you. A great cloud, open in the
          centre, will come down from above and surround us all, so that none
          shall see whither he goes. Until then those who would go must do as
          you bid them. All males, boys or men, must have caps of deerskin
          with the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          beads on four sides, and two eagle feathers attached to the top,
          ready to wear on the journey. They must also have new shirts,
          leggings, and moccasins upon which this figure has been made in
          black and white.</p><a name="fig46" id="fig46"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The plain Greek
          cross and the crescent have been used by the Apache as decorative
          and religious symbols from early times, but this recent adaptation
          of the combined form came as a sudden wave.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With an
          unusually strong personality, Das Lan had long been held in fear by
          those who knew him best, and with his story of the new messiah he
          soon became of great prominence in the tribe. Das Lan first made
          confidants of the leading spirits in the various bands, who in turn
          converted others to the new faith before public announcement was
          made. Having won the strongest men in the tribe through personal
          appeal to their vanity, the crafty Das Lan could now remain at
          home, enjoying the prosperous practice that grew out of his new
          cult.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Throughout the
          reservation those most deeply affected by the messiah belief have
          been appointed spies over the others. If any<span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page045">[pg 045]</span><a name="Pg045" id="Pg045"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> persist in the use of old medicine
          paraphernalia, they are reported at once and harassed by threats of
          plague, sickness, ill-luck, disaster, and even death, which Das Lan
          claims to be able to cause or to dispel at pleasure. Once the
          threat is made, nothing unwelcome can happen to one under the ban
          that is not immediately attributed, by all the medicine-man's
          disciples, to the disfavor of the gods; and nothing more potent is
          necessary to convert the unbeliever, for there is no Indian reared
          in the wilds who is not steeped in the belief that his gods are
          all-powerful in both causing and eradicating every ill.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">About two years
          ago, on the Cibicu, a woman murdered her husband. She did not deny
          the act, but pleaded justification, alleging that her husband was
          guilty of unfatherly conduct toward his daughter. The local
          authorities were very sceptical of her defence, since the murdered
          man had always borne an excellent reputation among both Indians and
          whites; but no contradictory evidence could be adduced upon which
          to base an open trial, so the matter became quieted. After time had
          cancelled the crime in the mind of the guilty, it became known that
          the murder had been committed at the instigation of the scheming
          Das Lan, who found the deceased an obstacle to his prophetic
          assumptions, and under the guise of an order from Kútĕrastan had
          him despatched. Naturally fierce, strong, and bold, Das Lan has
          become more emboldened by his success as a prophet, and indirect
          threats of further crafty murders are sometimes uttered by the more
          fanatical members in each band when anyone presumes to defy his
          creed and will.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In 1903,
          throughout the White Mountain reservation, the Government farmers
          found it difficult to persuade the Apache to plant the usual corn.
          The following winter found them with a scant food supply, and
          Government aid was neccessary to relieve suffering. The cause of
          the failure to plant, none of the officials then knew; but to his
          tribesmen Das Lan had prophesied the probable advent of the messiah
          at that time—so why plant corn?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another effect
          of Das Lan's prophecy is noted in the fact that although a few
          years ago the Apache houses were scattered far and<span class=

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> wide, now there are many villages
          consisting of long straight rows of grass-thatched huts, bearing
          testimony to that deep-seated superstition which in the Apache
          apparently will never be eradicated.</p><a name="fig47" id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The ceremonial
          celebration of the arrival of the period of puberty in girls is
          more rigidly adhered to than any ancient religious rite or social
          custom in vogue among the Apache. By this ceremony the social
          position of the girl is established, and she is given assurance, on
          the eve of her womanhood, of a long, happy, active life. At this
          critical period, if the favor of the gods were not thus invoked in
          behalf of the girl, it might augur ill for her in after life.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This Nalín
          Bagúdzĭtash, or Girl Dance, is held always at dawn and is brought
          to a close when the sun shines full upon the participants. The
          ceremony is conducted by a woman selected from among the friends of
          the girl's parents for her comeliness, activity, and good
          character. So far as the performance of the successive parts of the
          ceremony is concerned, no special knowledge on the part of the
          leader is required, as a medicine-man is engaged to give the
          necessary directions and to sing the songs. The girl lies on a
          blanket upon the ground, and her sponsor, so to speak, straightens
          her arms and legs, rubs her joints, and otherwise simulates
          remoulding and beautifying her body. The girl then sits up, and
          those assembled dance and sing in a circle about her. An eagle
          feather and a white-shell bead are tied in her hair, and sacred
          pollen is rubbed on her face, in deference respectively to the bird
          of war and the god and goddess of health and
          fructification—Hádĭntĭn Skhĭn and Hádĭntĭn Nalín.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the dancing
          is finished the sponsor takes a basket of corn prepared for
          ceremonial use and deposits it fifty yards or more to the east of
          the circle. The girl arises and runs around the basket, then back
          to the blanket on the ground, followed by little boys and girls.
          The godmother then moves the basket farther away, and the girl runs
          around it again, followed by children<span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page047">[pg 047]</span><a name="Pg047" id="Pg047" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> as before. This performance is repeated four
          times at the east of the circle, after which the basket is carried
          around to the south and the girl runs around it four times again,
          then to the west, and lastly to the north. When she returns from
          her fourth run at the north the girl stops on the blanket as usual,
          where the basket of corn is emptied on her head. A lively scramble
          for the corn follows on the part of all present, for it is deemed
          good fortune to bear away a handful of the consecrated kernels,
          which, if planted, are certain to be very prolific.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The act of
          running out and back, followed by children, symbolically attests
          that the young woman will be strong and active throughout life,
          beloved by her offspring, who will always follow and obey her. That
          of pouring corn upon her head is an invocation to the gods that she
          may be blessed with fruitfulness.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The girl wears
          her ceremonial raiment of whitened deerskin or new white muslin,
          with a white feather, a stone bead, and a piece of shell in her
          hair, for four days after the performance, abstaining during that
          time from flesh and from food containing salt, being careful, too,
          not to scratch herself with her fingers. At the end of this period
          she bathes, dons her usual clothing, and partakes of the customary
          food.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Gáŭn
          Bagúdzĭtash, or Dance of the Gods, is the one ceremony of the
          Apache that bears any material resemblance to the many Yébĭchai
          dances or "chants" of the Navaho, and even then the only feature
          common to the two is that the men, typifying gods, wear elaborate
          masks. The Apache are not unfamiliar with the making and employment
          of dry-paintings for the treatment of the sick, as has been seen.
          Originally the dry-paintings and the <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">gáŭn</span></span>,
          or gods, always appeared together, but in recent<span class=

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> years the Gáŭn dance has been conducted
          preliminary to and as a part of medicine, puberty, and war
          ceremonies. Captain Bourke, in his "Medicine-men of the Apache"
          (Ninth Report of the Bureau of Ethnology, 1892), speaks of this as
          the Spirit or Ghost dance. Though performed infrequently now, as
          compared with other dances, on account of the expense and of
          disapproval by the agents, the Gáŭn Bagúdzĭtash is unquestionably
          the most popular ceremony conducted by the Apache.</p><a name=

          north, and Gaŭnĕskí̆dĕ the fun-maker. These are arrayed in short
          kilts, moccasins, and high stick hats supported upon tightly
          fitting deerskin masks that cover the entire head. Each carries two
          flat sticks about two feet in length, painted with zigzag lines
          representing lightning.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For the dance a
          circular plot of ground, fifty or sixty feet in diameter, is
          cleared of stones and brush, and four small cedar trees are planted
          about its edge, one at each of the cardinal points. All in
          attendance assemble in a circle outside the trees, leaving an
          opening at the eastern side. Unheralded the five masked personators
          march in from the east and take position in front of the cedar
          trees, the fifth man standing behind the fourth at the northern
          side. Four drummers with small drums and an indefinite number of
          drummers around a large one, at a signal from the medicine-man in
          charge, who sings, begin drumming. The personated gods dance all
          about the circle, making motions with their sticks as if picking up
          and throwing something away, followed by blowing with the breath
          for the purpose of expelling evil spirits from their midst. While
          this is going on the fifth masker, Gaŭnĕskídĕ, performs antics
          designed to amuse the audience. When the songs are finished the
          dancers depart in an eastwardly direction, whence they came, and
          all rest.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The drummers
          begin the next period in the dance by beating their tomtoms. As
          soon as they commence the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">gáŭn</span></span> again appear, coming from
          the east as before, and stop in single file in front of the cedar
          tree on the eastern side. There the spectators<span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page049">[pg 049]</span><a name="Pg049" id="Pg049"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> throw <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">hádĭntĭn</span></span> upon them and offer
          prayers, after which the five <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">gáŭn</span></span> take the same positions as
          before in front of the small trees. Upon the trees little wheels of
          cedar twigs have been hung; these the dancers now take, and each
          dances toward the fire in the centre of the circle and back four
          times. As the gods dance back and forth the people assembled in the
          encircling line shift their positions, so that all the women are on
          the north side and all the men on the south; then the entire body
          dances, with brief intervals of rest, while twelve songs are sung.
          The maskers next form in single file on the east, march around the
          fire, through the flames of which each passes the ends of his two
          sacred wands to destroy any lurking evil, then back around the
          eastern cedar tree, again around the fire, then to the southern
          tree, and so on to each of the four trees, when they take their
          leave.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This much
          constitutes that part of the ceremony in which the <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">gáŭn</span></span>
          are the chief participants and which usually occupies half the
          night. The remainder of the night is consumed by the performance of
          some ceremony forming the principal objective—often the puberty
          rite above described.</p><a name="fig53" id="fig53"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Jicarillas,
          or, as they are commonly called, "Jicarilla Apaches," occupy a
          reservation of nearly four hundred and fifty square miles of
          mountainous country in northern New Mexico. Linguistically the
          Jicarillas are of the same stock as the Apache of Arizona; but here
          the relationship ceases, for the two peoples have virtually no
          knowledge one of the other; each, according to their respective
          genesis myths, had their origin in the general region in which they
          live to-day, while the dialect, mythology, legends, and medicine
          rites of the Jicarillas more closely resemble those of the Navaho
          than any of the Apache groups. The designation "Jicarilla Apaches"
          is an inheritance from the early Spaniards, who were wont to
          designate as Apache any warlike tribe which had not been brought
          under subjection. Such were the Apaches de Nabajú (Navaho), the
          Apaches del Perrillo, the Apaches Gileños, Apaches Tejuas, Apaches
          Vaqueros, Apaches Faraones, Apaches Llaneros, Apaches Lipanes, and
          a host of others, of whom the Spanish missionaries and colonists
          had little or no knowledge except that derived, alas, from
          predatory raids on the peaceable Indians among whom they were
          established. The name "Apache," therefore, was applied in the Rio
          Grande country of New Mexico in much the same way as the term
          "Yavapai" was given in the Rio Colorado region of Arizona, and,
          naturally enough, it still survives.</p><a name="fig59" id=

          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Owing to their
          composite nature the Jicarillas are a peculiarly interesting group.
          Too small in numbers to resist the cultural influence of other
          tribes, and having been long in contact with the buffalo hunters of
          the great plains as well as in close touch with the pueblo of Taos
          with its great wealth of ceremony and ritual, it is not surprising
          that the Jicarillas, in life and ceremony,<span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page054">[pg 054]</span><a name="Pg054" id="Pg054" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> have been deeply influenced by adjacent
          tribes. As previously stated, the Jicarilla medicine rites are much
          like those of the Navaho, but are far simpler in character. In
          dress the Jicarillas resemble the Indians of the plains, even to
          the feather headdress, which is never worn by the tribes to their
          south and west. Features of an annual fiesta have been borrowed
          directly from the Pueblos.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The typical
          habitation of the Jicarillas is a tipi, or lodge, called
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">kozhán</span></span>, patterned after that of
          the Plains tribes. Formerly they hunted the buffalo, making
          periodical excursions from their mountain home to the plains and
          bringing back quantities of prepared meat and large numbers of
          hides, which were fashioned into tents and used for many other
          purposes. To all intents and purposes, therefore, the Jicarillas
          were a plains tribe. Only within recent years have they grown crops
          of any kind. They exhibit fair skill in basketry, this being their
          chief industry and source of barter with neighboring tribes; indeed
          it was through this custom of making "little baskets" that the
          Spaniards applied to them the name by which they are popularly
          known. The Pueblos of the Rio Grande use many baskets, which they
          obtain chiefly from the Jicarillas in exchange for corn. During
          late years many of these <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">jicarillas</span></span> have been disposed of
          to traders. Like the Navaho they make but little pottery, and that
          only for utilitarian purposes.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Jicarillas
          seem to have no system of clans or gentes. The tribe is divided
          into two bands—commonly called by their Spanish names, <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Olleros</span></span>
          (Potters) and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Llaneros</span></span> (Plainsmen)—within
          which marriage is not prohibited. In the days of the buffalo a part
          of the tribe, preferring the prairie country, remained there for a
          short time and received the name Kolhkahí<span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">n</span></span>,
          People of the Plains. The others returned to the mountains and from
          the pottery they there made were called Sait Ndĕ, Sand People, sand
          being used in mixing the clay. In event of marriage between members
          of different bands, sons born of the union belong to the father's
          band, while daughters belong to the band of the
          mother.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page055">[pg
          055]</span><a name="Pg055" id="Pg055" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Generally
          speaking, chieftainship is hereditary, passing to the eldest son,
          if there be such, otherwise to a brother, on the death of the
          incumbent; but this rule might be set aside if public opinion were
          strong enough to warrant it, and the chief be selected from another
          family. Each band has a headman, chosen by reason of his personal
          bravery and worthiness. The tribal chief, however, is the
          recognized leader, the two band chiefs being little more than
          figureheads.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The social
          customs of the Jicarillas are well defined. A young man wishing to
          marry sends a near relation to procure the consent of the girl's
          parents, with whose decision the wishes of the daughter have little
          weight. If the young man meets their approval, he is sent out to
          hunt, and the game which he kills is distributed among the girl's
          relations. The following day his family build a <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">kozhán</span></span>
          and place in it the personal effects of the young couple, who, at
          night, enter with friends and kinsfolk. A medicine-man prays to
          Nayé̆nayĕzganĭ, asking his beneficence toward the new home. This
          ceremony lasts until midnight, when the visitors depart and the
          marriage is consummated. Polygamy was common. Divorce is effected
          without ceremony, the discontented one deserting the other and
          leaving him or her in possession of the dwelling.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Property right
          is governed by tribal laws. The wife's belongings are inherited by
          her children or, if she should have none, by her parents, not by
          the husband. On the death of the husband his property passes to the
          children and the wife.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The dead are
          buried in secret, only a few of the close relations having
          knowledge of the place. Immediately after death the body is carried
          on horseback to a high point, where it is placed on the ground and
          covered with the personal possessions of the deceased, such as
          clothing, blankets, saddles, and weapons, and over all are heaped
          brush and stones. Formerly a man's horse was killed near his grave,
          and sometimes as many as three or four horses were similarly
          sacrificed at different places. In former times also the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">kozhán</span></span> was burned after the
          burial, and members of the family cut their hair as a sign of
          mourning.<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page056">[pg
          056]</span><a name="Pg056" id="Pg056" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          The souls of the dead are believed to rise skyward. In one portion
          of the sky, among vast herds of buffalo, all those who have met
          death in battle assemble, rich and happy; in another part, those
          who have succumbed to sickness and old age. The evil, or those who
          have practised witchcraft, have a place apart from the rest.
          Between the latter and the spirits of the good stands a high rock
          wall at which the evil ones are condemned to dig for eternity in an
          effort to reach the happier home. Spirits can work only in
          darkness, and the work of the night is ever brought to naught by
          recurring daylight.</p><a name="fig60" id="fig60"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Jicarillas,
          like their kindred the Navaho and Apache, pay much attention to
          religion and ceremony. Compared with the Navaho their life seems
          almost lacking in ceremony, but when contrasted with the various
          Yuman tribes on the Colorado and Gila rivers of Arizona it is
          fairly rich. Their healing or medicine rites include a dance,
          called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Isánĕ</span></span>, that occupies four days
          and four nights, and many one-day "sings," in all of which
          dry-paintings are employed. Like the Apache the Jicarillas attach
          much importance to the girls' puberty ceremony and still rigidly
          adhere to it.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A four-day
          medicine dance is founded on the following legend:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Two maidens
          lived at the bottom of a deep pit. Many of the men wished to marry
          them, but the girls were well content and refused to come out. The
          Bear and the Snake formed a plan to carry them off and make them
          their wives. A beautiful butterfly was sent fluttering down over
          the girls' heads, but they paid little heed to its beauties.
          Another was sent, then another, and yet a fourth, which was so
          beautiful that the girls reached up to catch it, for they wished to
          copy its splendid colors on a large basket they were weaving. But
          the butterfly escaped them and flew upward, keeping ever out of
          reach as the girls followed to the mouth of the pit. There the Bear
          and the Snake in waiting suddenly reached over, seized the girls,
          and carried them away. The people, learning of this, asked them to
          bring the girls back, but the Bear and the Snake refused, so an
          appeal was made to Nayé̆nayĕzganĭ and Kobadjischínĭ. These two gods
          built a fence<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page057">[pg
          057]</span><a name="Pg057" id="Pg057" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          around the world to keep the Bear and the Snake from escaping, and,
          summoning all the people, compelled the Bear and the Snake to bring
          the two young women back. The one the Bear had married had grown
          very fat and coarse, like her master. "What have you done to make
          this girl so fat?" demanded Nayé̆nayĕzganĭ in anger. "You must give
          her medicine to make her comely again." So the Bear sang songs and
          made medicine until the girl was herself again. Then came the Snake
          with the girl he had stolen. She had become thin, like her master.
          "What have you done to make this girl so thin?" cried
          Nayé̆nayĕzganĭ. "You must give her medicine to make her well
          again." The Snake then sang his songs and made medicine until the
          girl became again robust and beautiful.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As already
          mentioned, the performance of this ceremony extends through a
          period of four days and four nights. The day preceding is spent in
          preparation: the head of the family of the sick person makes ready
          for a feast, and helpers build a corral of piñon and spruce
          branches. This corral is circular, about forty yards in diameter
          and six feet high, with an opening at the east. To the west, close
          to the fence, is the medicine <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">kozhán</span></span>. The latter part of each
          morning of the four days is spent by the medicine-man and his
          assistants in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">kozhán</span></span>, where a dry-painting of
          blue, black, yellow, and red earths is made in the shape of a snake
          lying in a circle with a space between the head and the tail. The
          circle is about six feet in diameter, and within it are represented
          numerous animals: the bear, turkey, deer, eagle, buffalo, elk,
          badger, gopher, and others. A decoction is mixed in an earthen bowl
          and the patient is summoned. Sand from the various parts of the
          painting are sprinkled on the corresponding parts of his body, and
          the medicine mixture is given him to drink.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The night
          portions of the ceremony begin shortly after dark. The medicine-man
          and any persons who know the songs gather in the <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">kozhán</span></span>
          and sing, accompanied with a drum made of a basket inverted over a
          hole in the ground and covered with a buffalo skin, the head toward
          the east. The hole represents the pit in the legend, the basket the
          one the girls were weaving, and a<span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page058">[pg 058]</span><a name="Pg058" id="Pg058" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> figure interwoven in the latter symbolizes
          the butterfly of the story. The beating of the drum is varied at
          intervals by the use of a leg-bone of a mountain sheep rasped
          quickly over a notched stick. Any men of the tribe may enter the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">kozhán</span></span>, and even a white man who
          is well known. The songs consist of recitals of the powers of the
          medicine-man and invocations to the various animals, as the bear,
          snake, and mountain sheep. Some of the songs consist merely in
          naming the parts of the animal's body, while others are supposed to
          be those used by the Bear and the Snake in the legend. After
          singing these songs for about three hours, with intervals of rest,
          the dancing begins. On each side of the enclosure are three fires.
          Behind these on the north side are the men, on the south the women;
          thus a large open space is bounded by the two lines of fires, the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">kozhán</span></span>, and the opening of the
          corral. Two women walk slowly into this space, their heads modestly
          bent. They stop, and a young man approaches to ascertain with whom
          they would dance. He then finds the desired persons, takes each by
          the arm, and drags him out. The men always feign unwillingness to
          go. In the meanwhile other pairs of women have come out and other
          young men become busy finding partners for them. As a rule they
          dance in groups of four, men and women facing each other and moving
          backward and forward five or six steps. As the dance progresses the
          man is likely to lay his hands upon the woman's shoulders, but
          modesty forbids her a similar liberty. The same pair may remain
          dancing together throughout the night, or they may cease when
          either desires. On the first night the dancing continues until
          about midnight; the second, an hour or two longer; the third, until
          well toward dawn; the fourth, until sunrise.</p><a name="fig61" id=

          planted near the door of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          dancing is introduced. About midnight, before any dancing has been
          engaged in, the ceremonial dancers enter from two dressing
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          are nude, save for the breech-cloth, with body and face painted in
          white and black, and the hair hanging loose. Immediately following
          them are the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic; vertical-align: super">n</span></span><span style="font-style: italic">zhiní̆</span></span>,
          six in number, accompanied by four keepers, two in front and two
          behind. The six are nude, the bodies painted solid white with six
          black stripes encircling them. The hair is painted white and is
          done up into two long, stiff braids, which project from the sides
          of the head like a pair of horns. The faces are hideously made up
          to represent clowns, as indeed their name signifies. In dancing,
          the Cha<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "vertical-align: super">n</span></span>zhiní̆ and Tsa<span class=

          shuffle sidewise, locomotion being effected by means of a sort of
          exaggerated shivering of the legs. This movement is common to
          Plains tribes in many of their dances. The whole line of dancers
          proceed with their peculiar motion into the <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">kozhán</span></span>
          and around the fire, passing before the patient, the

          "vertical-align: super">n</span></span>zhiní̆ all the while
          uttering hoarse, animal-like cries. Their utterances are always
          coarse and obscene, causing much merriment, which is supposed to
          aid the patient in casting off his illness. After passing through
          the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          and with their feet keep time to the singing and drumming, while
          the others break ranks and in a promiscuous throng pass before the
          spectators, first on the men's side, then on the women's. Just
          before their departure from the corral any woman who feels an
          indisposition may crouch in their path near the gate, facing the
          west, and the Cha<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "vertical-align: super">n</span></span>zhiní̆ one by one leap over
          her, first from the east, then from the other three directions,
          ever continuing their hoarse cries.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These characters
          make their appearance four times during the course of the night,
          the spectators dancing during the intervals. After their last exit
          dancing continues until shortly before sunrise; then the
          medicine-man and the singers arise, and, forming a circle about the
          fire in the centre of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">kozhán</span></span>, sing a number of songs.
          A maiden is summoned from the gathering to carry a basket of sacred
          meal, and the medicine-man, taking up the top of the spruce tree,
          passes out of the enclosure toward the rising sun, followed by the
          maiden, the patient, the singers, and any who may be afflicted with
          a bodily ailment. At a distance of about a hundred<span class=

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> yards the medicine-man stops and plants
          the little spruce tip, to which the disease is now supposed to have
          been transferred, under a tree, sprinkling over it quantities of
          the sacred meal. Then each of the others, the patient leading,
          steps forward, throws a pinch of the meal on the tree, and passes
          on, always facing the east. When the last one has thus passed, the
          procession stops, everybody holds his blanket ready, and on signal
          from the medicine-man, just as the sun appears, gives it a shake
          and runs at full speed to the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">kozhán</span></span> and around the fire. Thus
          is disease shaken out and the pursuit of the evil spirits of

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the beginning
          all people, birds, and beasts were far beneath this earth,
          somewhere in the darkness; there was no sun, no moon. It was not a
          good place in which to live, because of the darkness. After a time
          came Chunnaái, the Sun, and Klĕnaái, the Moon. They directed the
          people to leave the world of darkness, showing the way they were to
          go by passing up through a rift in the sky. But the sky was so far
          above that the people knew of no way to reach it, so they made a
          pile of sand in the form of a mountain, and painted the east side
          white, the south blue, the west yellow, and the north side all
          colors.[1] Then they gathered seeds from all the plants they knew
          and placed them inside the little mountain. Chunnaái sent back his
          messenger, Ánltsĭstn, the Whirlwind, to instruct them how to make
          the mountain increase in size.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then all
          gathered about it and danced and sang, until after four days the
          seeds sprouted and the mountain began to expand and to increase in
          height. This continued for four days, at the end of which time the
          mountain seemed almost to reach the sky; but suddenly its growth
          ceased, and none knew the cause. From<span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page061">[pg 061]</span><a name="Pg061" id="Pg061" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> Chunnaái came Whirlwind to tell the
          inhabitants how two of their maidens had entered the sacred space
          on the mountain top and had wantonly broken and destroyed plants
          and fruits, thus causing the mountain to cease growing.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With two long
          poles and four buffalo horns, which then were straight, the people
          made a ladder, which, when placed on the mountain top, reached the
          sky. One of the four Great Whirlwinds, Níchitso, went up to see
          what this new place was like. He put his head through the opening,
          and seeing that the world was covered with water, at once descended
          the ladder. The four Whirlwinds then went up; White Wind rolled the
          water to the east, but still there was water at the south; Blue
          Wind rolled it away to the south, but still there was water at the
          west; so Yellow Wind blew it away to the west, and then there was
          water only at the north, which All-Color Wind quickly blew away.
          Then the Winds blew over the earth for four days to dry it; but
          they left some of the water, which flowed along in streams.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When they
          returned and told what they had done, the people sent Ká̑gĕ, the
          Crow, who was wise, to view the land. They waited long, but Ká̑gĕ
          did not return. Then they sent Little Whirlwind, who found the Crow
          perched upon some dead bodies, plucking out their eyes; and because
          of his wickedness in forgetting the people, his feathers, once
          white, had turned black. Then Nagá<span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "vertical-align: super">n</span></span>schitn, the Badger, was sent
          to see if the land was good, but just as soon as he had crawled
          through he sank in the black mud and could go no farther, so Little
          Whirlwind was despatched to succor him. To this day Badger's legs
          are black. Next Kĕldi<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "vertical-align: super">n</span></span>shé̆n, the Skunk, was sent,
          because he was light in weight; but even he sank in the mud and
          blackened his legs. Then the people sent Cha, the Beaver, who
          travelled about for a long time, and finding all the water running
          away in streams, built dams and thus formed many lakes. He came
          back and told the people that the land was good to live in, which
          pleased them greatly. Then they started up the ladder, and when all
          had passed over, it was found that their weight had bent the
          buffalo horns, which ever<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page062">[pg

          earth at a place in the north.<a id="noteref_3" name="noteref_3"

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">During the first
          days the Sun did not rise above the horizon, having been held back
          in the east by a web that Ma<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "vertical-align: super">n</span></span>sché̆, the Spider, had woven
          about him. But the people succeeded in tearing the web away, and
          from that time the Sun each day has travelled across the whole
          sky.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On emerging from
          the underworld the inhabitants began moving in a great circle,
          travelling from the north to the east, then to the south, then to
          the west. When any found a spot that pleased them, they settled
          there, and Chunnaái and Klĕnaái gave them a language of their own.
          Four times the land was thus encircled, but each time the circle
          became smaller, and when the people came the last time to the
          north, Haísndayĭn, the Jicarillas, found their home in the

          and their sons lived together. To amuse the children the mothers
          made them a wheel, but cautioned them never to roll it toward the
          north. Whenever he heard the sound of water, Kobadjischínĭ, to seek
          its source, would leap straight into any torrent, and his mother
          hoped that the toy would deter him from falling into such danger.
          One day the two boys became curious to know what was in the north,
          so they rolled the wheel in that direction. It went straight on for
          a long time, then came<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page063">[pg

          A young girl, Yíyĕ's slave, was sent up to see who was outside.
          "Two young, fine-looking boys," she reported. Yíyĕ sent her to tell
          them to come into the cave, but this they refused to do, even when
          he urged them himself, saying, "No! Give us our wheel!" But at last
          the boys yielded to Yíyĕ's persuasions and proceeded up the ladder
          and down into the cave. Owl built a fire under a huge pot of water,
          seized the boys, and put them into it. He boiled them a long time,
          then lifted them out with a stick. They stood up and said, "Why do
          you not give us our wheel and let us go home?" Then Yíyĕ became
          angry and thrust them into a great heap of hot ashes and built a
          fresh fire over them. After a long time he took them out, but they
          were still unharmed, and only asked, "Why do you not give us our
          wheel?" At this Owl became very angry and, seizing them, cut them
          into small pieces, put them into the pot, and boiled them again;
          but when he took them out they were alive and whole. Owl said not a
          word, but gave them their wheel and motioned them to go. All this
          time the mothers of the two boys knew from the Sun where they were,
          and by a burning stick could tell when their children were in
          danger; for if they were safe the flame burned high, but if in
          danger it burned low.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Because there
          were so many monsters on the earth that destroyed people, the
          mothers of Nayé̆nayĕzganĭ and Kobadjischínĭ sent them on a visit to
          Chunnaái to learn how to kill these evil beings. Chunnaái sent down
          the rainbow, and up this the two boys climbed and went into the
          house of the Sun. For Nayé̆nayĕzganĭ the Sun made a complete suit
          of turquoise—shirt, leggings, and moccasins—and in his hair
          fastened a long eagle feather. He gave him also huge arrows made of
          pine trees pointed with flint of white, blue, yellow, and
          all-colors, and a bow made of a part of the rainbow. To
          Kobadjischínĭ he gave a suit of flint of many colors and a long
          whip with which to drive away sickness, and in his hair he tied a
          downy eagle<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page064">[pg
          064]</span><a name="Pg064" id="Pg064" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          feather. Then he said to Nayé̆nayĕzganĭ, "Shoot down and see if you
          can hit that tree." So Nayé̆nayĕzganĭ shot, and the arrow shattered
          the tree like a bolt of lightning.</p><a name="fig68" id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After his return
          from the home of the Sun, Nayé̆nayĕzganĭ and his mother, Yólkai
          Ĕstsán, went over to the pueblo of Taos, where in a lake lived a
          monster Turtle which had destroyed many people by dragging them
          beneath the water. Nayé̆nayĕzganĭ went into the village and asked
          for food, but the people refused him, not knowing who he was. In
          the night he sent worms into their corn, spoiling it all; and in
          the morning, when they discovered it, they were filled with fear,
          and said:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"You must be
          some great man. In the west is a large lake, and in it a being
          which has dragged many of our people into the water. Will you go
          and kill it?"</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"I will kill
          it," replied Nayé̆nayĕzganĭ, "but first you must give me as much
          turquoise as I now have in my suit."</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This they did,
          and Nayé̆nayĕzganĭ asked Chunnaái how he should kill this creature.
          His father gave him four wheels—white, blue, yellow, and
          all-colors. Then from the east he threw the white one into the
          middle of the lake, and the water receded a little. From the south
          he threw the blue wheel, from the west the yellow, from the north
          the wheel of all-colors, and each time the water decreased a little
          more, until a ladder leading downward was exposed. From the centre
          in four directions led rows of large stones, upon which Turtle
          walked in going to his house. Nayé̆nayĕzganĭ went out on one of
          these stone-trails and down the ladder. At the bottom he found two
          mountain lions, which he quieted by giving them eagle feathers. He
          went through a long passage and successively met two fierce bears,
          two snakes, and two spotted wildcats, but each in turn was pacified
          with eagle feathers. At the end of the passage was a door, which
          Nayé̆nayĕzganĭ burst open, coming suddenly upon the great Turtle.
          The monster tried in vain to seize and kill him, but Nayé̆nayĕzganĭ
          took out his fire-stick, and said:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"Release the
          people you have here, or I will destroy you with my
          fire!"</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page065">[pg
          065]</span><a name="Pg065" id="Pg065" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"I have only
          one," said Turtle, "and you may take him."</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the one
          came out Nayé̆nayĕzganĭ asked him if there were any more captives
          in the house, and the man said there were many more. So again he
          threatened Turtle, and other prisoners were released; but these
          were not all, and he compelled Turtle to free still more. On the
          fourth demand, however, the monster refused to give up any more of
          his prisoners, whereupon Nayé̆nayĕzganĭ killed him with his fire
          and smoke. Then going through the rooms he released all the people
          he found. There were two young Turtles, whom he told not to grow
          any larger, nor to kill people or animals; and small Turtles yet
          inhabit the land.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nayé̆nayĕzganĭ
          heard that to the east of the mountains of the Haísndayĭn lived
          Tzĕs, the enormous Elk, in the midst of a great high plain, which
          no one could approach unseen. So he journeyed thither, thinking to
          ascend the eastern side; but Elk saw him, and he went no closer.
          Then he tried from the south, the west, and the north, but always
          Elk saw him. At the northern side of the plain Nayé̆nayĕzganĭ heard
          someone ask, "What are you doing here?"</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was
          Maínĕli<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "vertical-align: super">n</span></span>, the Gopher; and when he
          learned what Nayé̆nayĕzganĭ wished to do, he promised his help. So
          he burrowed into the ground and came up under the spot where Elk
          was lying, and just behind the shoulder gnawed away the thick hair
          that protected the monster's heart. Elk felt the gnawing, and cried
          out, "Who is doing that?"</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Gopher answered,
          "I need fur to make a nest for my little children."</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So Elk became
          quieted and Gopher went back into the ground, and from the centre
          dug holes in four directions to the edge of the plain.
          Nayé̆nayĕzganĭ then entered one from the east, and coming to the
          centre looked up and saw Elk's heart beating. Drawing his
          flint-pointed arrow to the head, he shot the monster through the
          heart, then quickly dropped down into Gopher's burrow beneath four
          stones which, one below the other, stopped the vertical channel.
          But first he made with his<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page066">[pg
          066]</span><a name="Pg066" id="Pg066" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          fire-stick a dense white smoke at the end of the burrow that ran to
          the east. Elk leaped down into the opening and rushed in the
          direction of the smoke, seeking his enemy. Then in his rage he went
          to the centre, but in the meantime Nayé̆nayĕzganĭ had made a cloud
          of blue smoke at the south, so Elk ran thither. Successively
          Nayé̆nayĕzganĭ made yellow smoke at the west and all-color smoke at
          the north, each time at the mouth of the burrow, and each time Elk
          ran in the direction of the newly made smoke. All the time blood
          was pouring from the wound in Tzĕs' heart. At last he espied the
          hole blocked with four stone doors of white, blue, yellow, and
          all-colors, which led straight down from the floor of the passage.
          With his great antlers the monster broke through the first three
          doors, but at the fourth he fell dead. Nayé̆nayĕzganĭ divided the
          meat with Gopher, and taking the greater portion on his back, for
          by this time he was grown large and strong, he started back to his
          mother, who was overjoyed by his safe arrival and because he had
          brought such a quantity of meat. Near the village he stopped to
          rest, and the weight of himself and of Elk's body flattened the top
          of the hill on which he sat. Where Elk's blood soaked into the
          ground the soil is still red.</p><a name="fig69" id="fig69"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From his father,
          Chunnaái, Nayé̆nayĕzganĭ had knowledge of another evil thing and
          how to destroy it. Cutting off a piece of Elk's intestine, he
          filled it with blood and fastened it about his waist. Then he told
          his mother to strip off the hide and while it was still soft sew it
          into a suit that would cover him completely. When the suit was
          finished he put it on, hid Elk's antlers under it, and departed
          westward in search of Itsá, the Eagle, who every day killed a man.
          When Nayé̆nayĕzganĭ approached the home of Eagle the latter swooped
          down from his high rock and four times tried to seize him, but
          could not fasten his talons in the hardened hide. At the fourth
          attempt Nayé̆nayĕzganĭ allowed Eagle to take hold of his suit in
          the front, whereupon the bird carried him up and up, and from a
          tremendous height dropped him upon the sharp rocks. Though unhurt,
          to deceive Eagle he tore open the piece of intestine,<span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page067">[pg 067]</span><a name="Pg067" id="Pg067"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> allowing the blood to gush out upon the
          rock. Itsá told his two children to go and eat, but when they drew
          near Nayé̆nayĕzganĭ made a sound, "Sh!" and they stopped in fright.
          Again they came near and again heard the sound "Sh!" So the Eaglets
          went to their father, perched high on the point of the rock, and
          said:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"That body is
          not dead, it makes a noise 'Sh!'"</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"Never mind
          that; go and eat!" commanded the parent Eagle, who then flew away
          for his day's hunting.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When Itsá was
          gone, Nayé̆nayĕzganĭ arose, took off the elk-skin suit, and
          addressed the frightened Eagle children:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"In what weather
          does your father come home?"</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"In a great
          storm of thunder and lightning," they answered.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"And in what
          weather does your mother come home?"</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"When all the
          sky is clouded and a slow rain falls."</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Presently a
          great storm arose, and the Eaglets exclaimed, "Our father is
          coming!" Soon the Eagle came rushing through the air, and from afar
          Nayé̆nayĕzganĭ heard wailing, for Eagle had a man in his talons.
          From far aloft, as was his wont, he dropped the man upon the rocks.
          Nayé̆nayĕzganĭ took up one of Elk's antlers and just as the great
          bird was alighting on his perch hurled it at him, striking him on
          the head. Listening, he heard the body drop upon the rocks far
          below. Then a slow rain began to fall, and the Eaglets cried, "Our
          mother is coming!" Soon the mother Eagle came. She too had a man in
          her talons, and with the other horn Nayé̆nayĕzganĭ killed her. Then
          he warned the Eagle children that they must not grow any larger, or
          ever attempt to carry away people; and they promised to be content
          with hunting animals.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But
          Nayé̆nayĕzganĭ found that there was no way to get down from the
          rock, for it was steep and very high, so high that it made him
          dizzy to look over the edge. Chunnaái told him to wait there, for
          he would send someone to bring him down safely. At last
          Nayé̆nayĕzganĭ saw somebody below, who proved to be Bat.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"Come, help me
          down!" he called.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page068">[pg

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Bat came up,
          flying round and round the rock. On his back was a basket,
          supported from his shoulders by two cords that looked like Spider's
          thread.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"That will not
          hold me!" exclaimed Nayé̆nayĕzganĭ.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"But it will,"
          answered Bat; "it will hold the biggest of mountain sheep!" And to
          prove the truth of his assertion he filled the basket with stones
          and jumped up and down, and the threads held. Then Nayé̆nayĕzganĭ
          was satisfied and got in, and Bat began the descent. "Don't open
          your eyes!" he commanded. After a long time, feeling that they must
          be near the bottom, Nayé̆nayĕzganĭ opened his eyes, but the sight
          made him dizzy, and he almost fell out of the basket. Bat became
          angry at this, for the lurch almost threw him from the rock. At
          last, however, they reached the ground in safety.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There they
          dragged the bodies of the two great Eagles together, plucked them,
          and filled Bat's basket with the feathers, which Nayé̆nayĕzganĭ
          wished to take home. "Don't go in the low places," he advised Bat,
          as the latter started on ahead. But Bat forgot, and because the
          walking was easier went across the low places, where the birds
          stole all the feathers for their nests; so he had to return and
          fill the basket again. These he carried safely to Yólkai Ĕstsán,
          who gave many of them to the people of the village.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From Chunnaái,
          Nayé̆nayĕzganĭ learned of one more monster on the earth, a huge
          Rolling Stone, which lived in the south near the pueblo of Picuris;
          so he and his mother went southward. They stopped in a cañon
          through which Rolling Stone often passed on its way to and from the
          village, and by and by it came crashing along, destroying
          everything in its path. Just as it passed, Nayé̆nayĕzganĭ shot with
          one of his great flint-pointed arrows and shattered it, as he had
          shattered the tree when Chunnaái first gave him his weapons; and
          the ground in that spot is still red from the blood that flowed
          from Rolling Stone's heart.</p>

          people. Haschí̆n made the animals, mountains, trees, and rivers,
          gave the people weapons and implements, and showed how they were to
          be used. When all were supplied with houses to live in and weapons
          with which to protect themselves and to kill game, he called
          Coyote, Tsilité̆n, the Mimic.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"Go to the Land
          of the Fireflies," he commanded, "and bring back their fire, for
          the people have no fire with which to cook their food."</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Coyote started,
          and found the Land of the Fireflies. These beings lived at the
          bottom of a deep, deep hole—an enormous cave in the solid rock. Its
          sides were smooth and straight, and how to get down Coyote did not
          know. He went to the edge of the pit, and there found growing
          Little Tree.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"Help me down to
          the Land of the Fireflies," he said. So Little Tree sent its roots
          down, down, down, until they extended quite to the bottom, and
          Coyote descended. There he played with the little Firefly boys,
          romping about, running back and forth, pretending to be thinking of
          nothing but their amusement, for the Fireflies guarded their fire
          carefully and would let no one touch it.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the tip of
          his tail Coyote had tied a tuft of cedar bark. Suddenly he dashed
          through the great fire which always burned in the centre of the
          village, and was off before the Firefly people knew what he had
          done. When they discovered that he had stolen some of their fire,
          they set out in pursuit; but Coyote was very swift of foot, and
          reached the wall of the pit far ahead of them.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"Little Tree,
          help me out!" he called.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Little Tree drew
          its roots up, up, up, while Coyote held on and was drawn safely out
          of the hole. Then he ran quickly about among the people, lighting
          the piles of wood they had prepared, until every family was
          supplied with fire.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Navaho are a
          pastoral, semi-nomadic people whose activities centre in their
          flocks and small farms. Their reservation of more than fourteen
          thousand square miles is the desert plateau region of northern
          Arizona and New Mexico. Its mesas and low mountains are sparsely
          covered with piñon and cedar, and on the higher levels are small
          but beautiful forests of pine. Back and forth in all parts of this
          vast region the Navaho drive their flocks. At the season when the
          slight rainfall produces even scant pasturage on the desert plains
          the flocks are pastured there; but as the grass becomes seared by
          the summer sun and exhausted from pasturing, the flocks are taken
          into the mountains, where the shade of the pines lends grateful
          coolness. Again, as the deep snows of winter come, the sheep and
          goats are driven down to the wooded mesas, where there is little
          snow and an abundance of fuel, of which there is none on the
          plains. And so, year in, year out, the flocks slowly drift back and
          forth from plain to mesa and from mesa to mountain.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While the Navaho
          leads a wandering life, the zone of his movements is surprisingly
          limited; indeed the average Navaho's personal knowledge of his
          country is confined to a radius of not more than fifty miles. The
          family usually has three homes, the situation of which is
          determined by the necessities of life. Near their summer home they
          cultivate small crops of corn and vegetables in narrow, sandy
          washes, where by deep planting sufficient moisture is insured to
          mature the crop. In a few sections small farming is conducted by
          means of irrigation. In Cañon de Chelly, which may be termed the
          garden spot of the reservation, there are diminutive farms and
          splendid peach orchards irrigated with freshet water. The cañon
          drains an extensive region, and even a light<span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page074">[pg 074]</span><a name="Pg074" id="Pg074"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> rain causes the stream which flows at
          the base of its lofty walls to become swollen. This water the
          natives divert to their miniature cornfields and orchards, one or
          two freshets assuring good crops.</p><a name="fig79" id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Owing to its
          lowness and its earth covering, the Navaho house, or <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">hogán</span></span>,
          is the most inconspicuous of habitations. One might ride from
          morning till night across the reservation and not observe either a
          hogán or an Indian, although he has no doubt passed within a
          stone's throw of many of these houses and been peered at by many
          more dark eyes from brush concealments. At the end of a long day in
          the saddle the traveller may wonder where the many thousands of
          Navaho reside; but his inquiry may be answered if he will but climb
          to the summit of one of the many low mountains and view the
          panorama as the long shadows of evening are creeping on. Here and
          there in every direction the thin blue smoke of the campfire may be
          seen curling upward as these desert people prepare their evening
          meal. In this clear, rare atmosphere the far distant horizon is the
          only limit to his vision. Just below, a mile or so away, may
          perhaps be seen the smoke from a group of half a dozen hogáns.
          Miles beyond is another group, and still beyond another, and so
          throughout the sweep of vision. These people and their life are
          delightfully Indian, but slightly influenced by the white man's
          ways. As the chief human touch of the great southwestern desert the
          Navaho are the artist's joy, and as a subject for the ethnologist
          their ceremonial life furnishes limitless material for study.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The handicraft
          of the Navaho is seen at its best in their blanketry, which is one
          of the most important industries of any Indians within our domain.
          The greater portion of the wool from their hundreds of thousands of
          sheep is used in weaving, and in addition a considerable quantity
          of commercial yarn is employed for the same purpose. The origin of
          the textile art among the Navaho is an open question. It is
          probable that they did not learn it from anyone, but that it
          developed as a part of their domestic culture. It is contended by
          some that the early Spanish missionaries taught the Navaho to
          weave; but why should the white man be accredited with this art?
          The mummies<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page075">[pg
          075]</span><a name="Pg075" id="Pg075" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          found in the prehistoric cliff-ruins of the Navaho country are
          wrapped in cloth finer than any ever produced with a Navaho loom,
          and no doubt now remains that Pueblo people were incorporated by
          the Navaho in ancient times.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The blankets
          made in earlier days, say from fifty to a hundred and fifty years
          ago, are beautiful examples of primitive handicraft. The body of a
          so-called bayeta blanket was woven of close-spun native wool, dyed
          dark blue, while the red pattern was from the ravellings of Spanish
          bayeta. Much of the beauty of the old blankets is due to the
          mellowing of the native colors by age, but practically none of
          these rare examples are to be found among the Navaho at the present
          time. The blankets of to-day may be roughly divided into three
          classes: 1. Those made from the close-spun native yarn dyed in the
          old colors and woven in the simple old patterns; when aged they
          closely resemble the old bayeta blankets. 2. Blankets woven in a
          great variety of designs from coarse, loose-spun yarn dyed with
          commercial dyes of many shades; these are the Navaho blankets of
          commerce. 3. Those woven from commercial or "Germantown" yarn; they
          are of fine texture and sometimes beautiful, but lack interest in
          that their material is not of Indian production. Fortunately the
          decrease in the demand for blankets woven of commercial yarn is
          discouraging their manufacture.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Navaho woman
          weaves her blanket not so much for profit as for love of the work.
          It is her recreation, her means of expressing imagination and her
          skill in execution. Civilized women may write books, paint
          pictures, or deliver ringing addresses; these are unknown worlds to
          the Navaho woman: but when after months of labor she finishes a
          blanket, her pride in her work of art is indeed well justified.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Because of their
          pastoral life the Navaho are not villagers. Their dome-shaped,
          earth-covered hogáns are usually grouped two or three in the same
          locality. The summer house is a rude brush shelter, usually made
          with four corner posts, a flat top of brush, and a windbreak of the
          same material as a protection against the hot desert siroccos. The
          hogán proper, used for storage<span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page076">[pg 076]</span><a name="Pg076" id="Pg076" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> during the summer, affords a warm and
          comfortable shelter to its occupants through the cold winters of
          their high altitude. When a hogán is built it is ceremonially
          consecrated, and if an occupant should die in it, it is forever
          deserted and is called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">tsí̆ndi hogán</span></span>, "evil house." No
          Navaho will go near such a house or touch anything taken from it.
          If a meal were cooked with decayed wood from a hogán a hundred
          years deserted, a Navaho, even if starving, could not be induced to
          partake of it. Thus strong are the religious beliefs of this
          primitive people.</p><a name="fig80" id="fig80"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The domestic
          equipment of the Navaho is simplicity itself and reflects the
          simple life of the tribe. Of household furniture there is none. The
          bedding consists usually of a few sheepskins; cooking utensils are
          earthen pots of their own making, and cups, knives, and spoons of
          civilization. Plates they do not need, as the family eat directly
          from the pot in which the food is cooked. The principal food is
          mutton, boiled, and corn prepared in many ways. Considerable flour
          obtained from traders is consumed; this is leavened slightly and
          made into small cakes, which are cooked over the embers like
          Mexican tortillas.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The women are an
          important factor in the Navaho tribe. The sheep usually, and the
          house, with all that pertains to it, always are the property of the
          wife. The independent spirit of the women, instilled by this
          incontestable property right, manifests itself throughout the
          tribe, and by reason of it the Navaho husband is not apt to seek an
          opportunity to criticise his wife so long as she is in a position
          to say, "If I and the hogán do not suit you, go elsewhere!"
          Polygamy is common, but as a rule the wives of one man are sisters,
          an arrangement conducive to domestic harmony.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Many of the
          Navaho men are skilled silversmiths. Every well-to-do Navaho
          possesses a silver belt consisting of a dozen or more wrought oval
          discs, each about two by three inches, fastened to a leather strap.
          Such a belt, weighing several pounds, is of course a valuable piece
          of property. The wearer may also have a broad silver bracelet set
          with turquoise, a heavy string of silver beads with a massive
          pendant of the same material, and a<span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page077">[pg 077]</span><a name="Pg077" id="Pg077" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> pair of deerskin leggings with a row of
          silver buttons on the outer side. Frequently their horses are gaily
          bedecked with bridles and saddles heavily weighted with silver
          ornaments. The long strap over the shoulder, from which the pouch
          of the medicine-man is suspended, is always studded with silver
          buttons. Mexican coins, especially the peso, are the principal
          source of all this silverwork, the Navaho preferring this coin to
          our own dollar because it is heavier. Buttons and beads also are
          made from American dimes and twenty-five cent pieces; the small
          beads from dimes, and the larger ones from two coins of the same
          value. They learned silversmithing from the Mexicans, but since
          their first lessons have developed a high degree of individuality
          in the art. While the metal-work of the Navaho at the present time
          is practically all in silver, only a few copper objects being made,
          their earliest work in metal was with iron, and occasionally an
          example of this is found. The silver and shell bead jewelry of the
          Navaho is his savings bank. During times of prosperity he becomes
          the possessor of all the jewelry his means afford, and when poor
          crops or long winters threaten distress he pawns it at a trader's,
          so that many of the traders often have thousands of dollars' worth
          of silverwork and shell beads on hand at one time. The system seems
          to be a very fair one, and in time of stress is certainly a boon to
          the impecunious Navaho.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The little
          pottery made by this people is an undecorated ware for utilitarian
          purposes only. For carrying water a gum-coated water bottle of
          basketry is in general use. Few baskets are made, and these are of
          but a single pattern—a flattish tray for use in ceremonies. Most of
          the baskets used by the Navaho in their ceremonies, however, are
          purchased from neighboring tribes, especially the Havasupai and the
          Paiute, who weave them primarily for purposes of trade. Such
          baskets must be of a prescribed pattern, with a break in the design
          at one side. When the basket is in use this side is always placed
          toward the east.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Most Navaho
          ceremonies are conducted, at least primarily, for the purpose of
          healing disease; and while designated medicine ceremonies, they
          are, in fact, ritualistic prayers. There are<span class=

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> so many of these ceremonies that no
          student has yet determined their number, which reaches into scores,
          while the component ritual prayers of some number hundreds. The
          principal ceremonies are those that require nine days and nine
          nights in their performance. Of the many now known the names of

            "text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1.00em">This, the first of
            the dry-paintings employed in the rites of the Mountain Chant—a
            nine days' healing ceremony of the Navaho—as in the Night Chant,
            is used on the fifth night, when the purpose of the performance
            is to frighten the patient, and thus banish the evil within him.
            The name of this painting, "Frighten Him On It," is identical
            with that of the one used at the corresponding moment in the
            Night Chant.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style=
            "text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1.00em">The whole represents
            the den of a hibernating bear. Inside the ceremonial hogán is
            thrown up a bank of earth two or three feet high, with an opening
            toward the doorway. Colored earths picture bear-tracks leading
            in; bear-tracks and sunlight—sun dogs—are represented at the four
            quarters, and the bear himself, streaked with sunlight, in the
            centre. The twigs at the entrance of the bear den represent
            trees, behind which bears are wont to dig their dens in the
            mountain side. Everything tends to make the patient think of
            bears. He enters midst deep silence and takes his seat upon the
            pictured animal. The play of his imagination has barely begun
            when a man, painted and garbed as a bear, rushes in, uttering
            hideous snarls and growls, in which all assembled join. Women
            patients seldom fail to faint.</p>
          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The figures
          shown in the dry-paintings are conventionalized representations of
          the characters in Navaho mythology and of incidents in the myth.
          With how many such paintings the Navaho medicine-men are familiar
          is an unanswered question; but more than sixty have been noted,
          some of them most elaborate. In making them, the ground within the
          ceremonial hogán is evenly covered with fine brown earth, upon
          which the figures are drawn with fine sands and earths of many
          colors allowed to flow between the thumb and the first two fingers.
          The Navaho become so skilled in this work that they can draw a line
          as fine as a broad pencil mark. Many of the paintings are
          comparatively small, perhaps not more than four feet in diameter;
          others are as large as the hogán permits, sometimes twenty-four
          feet across. To make such a large painting requires the assistance
          of all the men who can conveniently work at it from early morning
          until mid-afternoon.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The most
          elaborate ceremonies are conducted between the first frost of
          autumn and the second moon following the winter solstice. While
          primarily designed to restore the health of an individual, they are
          intended also to benefit the entire tribe, many of the prayers
          being offered for the general welfare of the<span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page079">[pg 079]</span><a name="Pg079" id="Pg079"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> people rather than for the patient
          under immediate treatment. Nor, so far as the individual is
          concerned, is the ceremony designed necessarily for the cure of an
          acute ailment, but is for the treatment of long-standing chronic
          afflictions, mental or physical. Especially peculiar is the Navaho
          belief that many illnesses are the results of fright to which
          ancestors have been subjected during prenatal life, and long and
          costly ceremonies are often performed to rid persons of such
          baneful inheritance. In fact Indians physically normal have
          submitted to prolonged treatment by their medicine-men when advised
          by them for such imaginative reasons to submit to it.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
          medicine-men, who are termed singers, <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">hatálĭ</span></span>,
          are a dominant factor in the Navaho life. Like all primitive
          people, the Navaho are intensely religious, and the medicine-men,
          whose function it is to become versed in the mysteries of religion,
          are ever prone to cultivate in the minds of the people the belief
          that they are powerful not only in curing disease of mind and body
          but of preventing it by their incantations. Anyone who possesses
          the requisite ability may become a medicine-man, but owing to the
          elaborate ceremonies connected with their practices it requires
          long years of application ere one can attain sufficient knowledge
          to give him standing among his tribesmen. To completely master the
          intricacies of any one of the many nine days' ceremonies requires
          close application during the major portion of a man's lifetime. The
          only way a novice has of learning is by assisting<span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page080">[pg 080]</span><a name="Pg080" id="Pg080"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the elders in the performance of the
          rites, and as there is little probability that opportunity will be
          afforded him to participate in more than two or three ceremonies in
          a year, his instruction is necessarily slow. The medicine-men
          recognize the fact that their ritual has been decadent for some
          time, and they regard it as foreordained that when all the
          ceremonies are forgotten the world will cease to exist.</p><a name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The most
          pronounced dread manifested by the Navaho is that derived from
          their belief respecting the spirits of the dead. It is thought that
          the spirit leaves the body at death and travels to a place toward
          the north where there is a pit whence the gods and the animals
          emerged from an underworld before the first Navaho were created,
          and which the dead now enter. Their myths tell of the disappearance
          of a beautiful daughter of one of the animal chiefs on the fourth
          day after the gods and the animals came up into this world;
          diligent search was unrewarded until two of the searchers looked
          down through the hole and espied her sitting beside a stream in the
          lower world combing her hair. Four days later death came to these
          searchers, so that now the Navaho will go to any extreme to avoid
          coming into contact with spirits of the dead, <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">tsí̆ndi</span></span>, which they believe
          travel anywhere and everywhere at will, often doing evil, but never
          good. The body is prepared for burial previous to death, and is
          never touched afterward if it can be avoided.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To the end that
          the spirit may begin aright its journey to the afterworld, the body
          is taken out of the hogán through an opening specially made in the
          wall on the northern side, for the doorway always faces the east.
          The immediate relatives of the deceased avoid looking at the corpse
          if possible. Friends of the family or distant relations usually
          take charge of the burial. A couple of men dig a grave on a
          hillside and carry the body there wrapped in blankets. No monument
          is erected to mark the spot. Before the body is taken out, the
          hogán is vacated and all necessary utensils are carried away. The
          two men who bury the remains of the former occupant carefully
          obliterate with a cedar bough all footprints that the relations of
          the deceased may have<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page081">[pg
          081]</span><a name="Pg081" id="Pg081" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          made in the hogán, in order to conceal from the departed spirit the
          direction in which they went should it return to do them harm. The
          premises are completely abandoned and the house often burned. Never
          will a Navaho occupy a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">tsí̆ndi hogán</span></span>, and when
          travelling at night he will take a roundabout trail in order to
          avoid one. Formerly horses were killed at the grave. So recently as
          1906 a horse was sacrificed within sight of a Catholic mission on
          the reservation, that its spirit might accompany that of a dead
          woman to the afterworld. This horse was the property of the woman,
          and her husband, fearing to retain it, yet not daring to kill it
          himself, called upon another to do so.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Although raiders
          and plunderers since known to history, the Navaho cannot be
          designated a warring tribe, for however courageous they may be,
          their lack of political integrity has ever been an obstacle to
          military organization. They never have had a tribal chief, properly
          so called, while their many leading men could never command more
          than a small following. Manuelito, who was acclaimed head-chief in
          1855 at the conference with Governor Meriwether for the purpose of
          negotiating a treaty, probably had a greater following than any
          other Navaho in historic times, but he could never have relied on a
          majority of the warriors of his widely scattered tribe. Although
          divided into many bands, like the Apache, the Navaho, unlike them,
          were not engaged in ceaseless depredation, their sporadic raids
          having been conducted by small parties quite independent of any
          organized tribal movement. They preferred rather to follow a
          pastoral life. With their large population, had they possessed the
          Apache's insatiable desire for war and a political organization
          that permitted concerted action, the subjugation of the Southwest
          would have been far more difficult than it proved to be.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While the
          statement is made that the Navaho were never a warlike people, it
          must not be presumed that they never caused our Government trouble.
          Those familiar with the Navaho<span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page082">[pg 082]</span><a name="Pg082" id="Pg082" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> admire their energy, industry, independence,
          and cheerful disposition, and their ability to attack the problems
          of life in a way that no other wandering tribe has exercised. On
          the other hand, cunning and trickery are among their
          characteristics, and they are expert horse-thieves. With the
          Indian, as well as with civilized man, honesty may be interpreted
          in various ways. If one should leave his camp equipage unprotected
          in a tent, it would be entirely safe from all except the renegade,
          already recognized by his people as a thief. But if one should turn
          his back and later find that his horse had been run off by a Navaho
          in the hope of being rewarded for returning it, the tribesmen of
          the raider would regard him as one whose cunning should be
          emulated.</p><a name="fig85" id="fig85"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For a long
          period prior to the acquisition from Mexico of the territory now
          forming the northern portion of Arizona and New Mexico, which,
          since first known, has been occupied in part by the Navaho, the
          tribe had been in the habit of making raids on the New Mexican
          Indian pueblos and the white settlements along the Rio Grande,
          chiefly for the capture of livestock, although both Indians and
          Mexicans also were taken and enslaved. The Mexicans lost no
          opportunity to retaliate, with the result that scattered throughout
          their villages in the valley of the Rio Grande there were more
          captives of Navaho blood than there were Mexican prisoners among
          the Navaho tribe; but in the matter of sheep, cattle, and horses,
          the Navaho were far ahead in the game of thievery, and even boasted
          that they could easily have exterminated the Mexicans had they not
          needed them as herders of their stolen flocks. In consequence,
          bitter enmity early arose between the Mexicans and the Navaho,
          which reached its height about the time Col. Stephen W. Kearny took
          possession of the territory in behalf of the United States in
          1846.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the year
          named a military expedition was sent into the Navaho country for
          the purpose of making a treaty of peace and friendship with this
          marauding tribe; but this treaty, like several others that
          followed, was soon broken, and the raids continued as before. In
          1858 the troubles arising from the plunderings became especially
          severe and led to several other expeditions, but with<span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page083">[pg 083]</span><a name="Pg083" id="Pg083"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> little result. The problem became a
          serious one in 1861, when the Civil War necessitated the withdrawal
          of troops from the frontier, leaving the way open to the
          devastation of the country by the Navaho and Mescaleros, until
          General Carleton, who assumed command of the military forces in New
          Mexico in 1862, formulated a policy to thoroughly subdue the Navaho
          and to transfer them to the Bosque Redondo, on the Rio Pecos in New
          Mexico, where Fort Sumner had been established, and there hold them
          as prisoners of war until some other plan could be devised. His
          plan was successfully carried out. By the spring of 1863 four
          hundred Mescaleros were under guard on the new reservation, and by
          the close of that year about two hundred Navaho prisoners had
          either been transferred thither or were on the way. Early in 1864
          Col. Kit Carson led his volunteers to the Cañon de Chelly, the
          Navaho stronghold, where in a fight he succeeded in killing
          twenty-three, capturing thirty-four, and compelling two hundred to
          surrender. The backbone of the hostility was now broken, and before
          the beginning of 1865 about seven thousand, later increased to
          8491, were under military control within the new reservation. But
          the Bosque Redondo proved unhealthful and disappointing as a
          reservation, while its maintenance was costly to the Government. A
          treaty was therefore made with the Navaho in 1868, one of the
          provisions of which was the purchase of fifteen thousand sheep to
          replenish their exterminated flocks. In July 7304 Navaho, the
          remainder having died or escaped, arrived at Fort Wingate on the
          way to their old home, where they have since lived in peace and
          prosperity.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Their world was
          small. At its eastern rim stood a large white mountain, and at the
          south a blue one. These formed the home of Ástsĕ Hástĭn, First Man.
          A yellow mountain in the west and a black one in the north harbored
          Ástsĕ Ĕstsán, First Woman.<a id="noteref_6" name="noteref_6" href=
          "#note_6"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">6</span></span></a> Near
          the mountain in the east a large river had its source and flowed
          toward the south. Along its western bank the people lived in peace
          and plenty. There was game in abundance, much corn, and many edible
          fruits and nuts. All were happy. The younger women ground corn
          while the boys sang songs and played on flutes of the sunflower
          stalk. The men and the women had each eight chiefs, four living
          toward each cardinal point; the chiefs of the men lived in the east
          and south, those of the women in the west and north. The chiefs of
          the east took precedence over those of the south, as did those of
          the west over those of the north.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One day, led by
          their eight brave chiefs, all the men went off on a hunt. It
          occurred to the head-chief when they had been gone but a short time
          that the women should have been instructed to clean the camp
          thoroughly and bake a quantity of bread while all the men were
          away; so he despatched the youngest of the four chiefs of the south
          to the camp to make<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page085">[pg
          085]</span><a name="Pg085" id="Pg085" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          known his wishes, but instead of doing as bidden, the young chief
          visited with the head-chief's wife. The hunters were gone four
          days, at the end of which time they returned with much game, weary
          and very hungry. To their surprise they found the camp in a very
          unkempt condition and no bread baked in anticipation of their
          return. The messenger was called before the head-chief at once and
          questioned as to the directions he had given the women. He
          explained that he had told the chief of the women what they were
          expected to do, but she refused to listen to him, and he was
          powerless to do more. Then the head-chief went to his wife and
          demanded to know why she had refused to issue his orders to the
          women. She curtly replied that that was her business and not his;
          as it was, the women did more work than the men, for they tilled
          the fields, made the clothing, cared for the children, and did the
          cooking, while the men did practically nothing, so if they chose to
          spend a few days in idleness, it was nothing more than they had a
          right to do and no one's concern but their own. The chief became
          angry, and during a quarrel that ensued he was told that he and all
          his followers might leave if they would, for the women could get
          along better without them.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Remonstrance and
          reasoning availed nothing; the chief of the women grew more
          vehement as she argued, so the head-chief determined to put the
          women to the test. The following morning he issued orders that all
          the men in camp prepare to depart, for the women had declared they
          could live better independently of them and were to be given an
          opportunity to do so.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Having decided
          to cross the great river flowing from the east, work at once began
          on four large cottonwood rafts to be used as ferries. Four days it
          took to put all in readiness, and at dawn of the fifth day the
          crossing of the stream began. Orders were issued that all food
          supplies, clothing, and utensils be left with the women, save
          enough seed corn to plant crops the next spring, and no males,
          infant or aged, were to be left behind. Four <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">nú̆tlĭ</span></span>
          (hermaphrodites) objected strongly at being taken from the women,
          but were forced to join the men, as they were needed<span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page086">[pg 086]</span><a name="Pg086" id="Pg086"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> to care for the babies. Four old
          cripples, too weak to move, were left behind, but other than these
          not a male inhabitant remained in the old village at the end of
          four days. After all had crossed the river, the rafts were fastened
          securely to the bank in order that the women might not get them and
          follow.</p><a name="fig89" id="fig89"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As soon as the
          men had landed they began to work with zeal, for houses had to be
          built, game caught, skins tanned, and land prepared for crops. They
          suffered much from scarcity of food and clothing the first winter,
          but managed to exist. The women, however, had bountiful crops, and
          all through the late fall and winter could be heard revelling in
          great delight, feasting daily and dancing much of the time to the
          music of songs sung by the four old cripples. The following autumn
          found the men in much better circumstances, for they had grown
          small crops; but the women were less fortunate. Having none but
          themselves to work and provide for, they had become negligent from
          the beginning, dissipating the contents of their granaries and
          allowing their fields to grow fallow. By the end of the second year
          clothing had become very scarce, and not knowing how to hunt, they
          had no way to obtain more skins. The men, on the contrary, had
          grown more prosperous; their well-tended farms yielded an ample
          supply of corn for the winter, and the pelts of deer and antelope
          furnished a deal of warm clothing and bedding. The third year found
          the men living in ease and comfort, while the women had become
          reduced to absolute want, many having fallen ill from self-neglect.
          They called across to the men, pleading to be taken over and
          promising faithful allegiance, but the chief was resolute and
          refused to forget how he had been wronged.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then it was that
          the youngest of the eight ruling men, in a moment of compassion,
          confessed his guilt, admitting in a plea to the head-chief for
          clemency that he was in fact responsible for the attitude his wife
          had taken. This served only to renew the old chief's anger; he
          stoutly refused to listen to further appeals and expressed his
          regret that the first seeds of wrong should have been thus sown. No
          longer able to keep up the fight,<span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page087">[pg 087]</span><a name="Pg087" id="Pg087" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> with starvation staring them in the face, and
          being in nakedness, at the end of the fourth year the women
          attempted to swim the river in parties, but the attempts resulted
          only in death, for the swift current would have been too much even
          for the strongest men to buffet. Seeing this self-sacrifice and
          realizing that the race would be ultimately exterminated if the
          women continued it much longer, appeals were made daily to the
          head-chief to permit the rescue of the remainder. Four times was he
          sought to grant such permission before he consented, then at dawn
          of the fifth morning he gave directions to loose the rafts and
          ferry the women over. A miserable remnant they were, unclad, wan,
          and wasted; but a return to the old habits of life soon restored
          them to their former selves, and peace, happiness, and prosperity
          reigned again.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The broad river
          that flowed from the east had its source in two very large springs,
          a he-spring and a she-spring, in which lived two large Water
          Monsters. These had a pair of youngsters who delighted in emerging
          from the depths of the spring and swimming out across the meadows
          in the shallow water where there was neither current nor river
          banks. Coyote spied them one day, and being ever a meddler and
          trouble-maker—though withal a fellow of polished mien—stole them,
          putting the two under the folds of his jacket.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now there was no
          sun, moon, or stars to give light; but in the east every morning
          appeared White Dawn four fingers high. The midday was lighted by
          Blue Dawn in the south, and late afternoon by Yellow Dawn from the
          west. The north remained always dark. On the morning following
          Coyote's return from his trip to the east, ostensibly to discover,
          if possible, the source of the dawn, the head-chief noticed that it
          was not so broad as usual—only three fingers high, with a dark
          streak beneath. A Wolf man was sent to learn what was wrong. He
          hurried off, returning at nightfall with the report that all was
          well in the east. The next morning White Dawn was much narrower and
          the darkness beneath had increased. A Mountain Lion messenger was
          despatched to seek the cause. He reported everything<span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page088">[pg 088]</span><a name="Pg088" id="Pg088"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> in normal condition, but those in camp
          noticed deer in the distance travelling westward at a rapid pace.
          The third morning the belt of darkness was wider than White Dawn,
          which now gave an alarmingly dim light. The chief then sent White
          Hawk to investigate the trouble, under orders of haste. His report,
          like that of each of the other messengers, was that nothing unusual
          appeared in the east. More deer, antelope, and other game animals,
          however, were seen running westward in apparent fright.</p><a name=

          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the fourth
          morning White Dawn was entirely obscured; nothing but darkness
          appeared in the east. Sparrow-hawk sped away, returning in a very
          brief time with the report that water was fast rising in the two
          springs at the head of the river and might soon spread westward in
          a great devastating wave. Instantly the camp became a scene of
          commotion. Quickly gathering together what corn and other seeds
          they could carry, the people started in haste for the White
          Mountain in the east. On reaching the top they saw the waters
          climbing rapidly up the eastern slope, so they descended and ran to
          the Blue Mountain in the south, taking with them handfuls of earth
          from its crest, and from its base a reed with twelve sections,
          which a Wolf man carried.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From the top of
          the Blue Mountain it was seen that the wave of water, fast
          approaching, would submerge them, so snatching handfuls of earth
          from it they hurried on to the Yellow Mountain in the west. The
          oncoming wave seemed higher than ever, so again they ran on, this
          time toward the north, where the Black Mountain stood, taking as
          before handfuls of earth and another reed, entrusted to Mountain
          Lion. Here the water surrounded them and slowly crept up the sides
          of the mountain. The female reed from the west was planted on the
          western side near the top, the male reed from the east on the
          eastern slope, and both at once began to shoot upward rapidly. Into
          the twelve internodes of the female reed climbed all the women,
          while the men made haste to get into theirs. Turkey being the last
          to get in, the foamy waters caught his tail, whitening the tips of
          the feathers, which are so to this day.</p><span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page089">[pg 089]</span><a name="Pg089" id="Pg089" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The reeds grew
          very rapidly, but equally fast rose the waters around them. Four
          days the reeds grew thus, at the end of the fourth day meeting at
          the sky. This seemed an impenetrable barrier for a time, but Locust
          had taken with him his bow of darkness and sacred arrows. With
          these he made a hole in the sky and passed on into the world
          above—the present earth.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The earth was
          small, devoid of vegetation of any kind, and covered in greater
          part by water in which lived four Monsters with great blue horns.
          These had their homes at the cardinal points, and just as soon as
          Locust made his appearance arrows came whizzing at him from all
          quarters. Failing to harm him with their arrows, which he dodged
          with ease, the Monsters bade him leave at once, threatening
          immediate death if he tarried; adding that visitors were not
          desired and were always destroyed at sight.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Locust replied
          that he intended no harm, but would insist upon remaining with them
          for a time, for he had many followers for whom he was seeking a
          home. Seeing that Locust had no fear of them and had proved too
          agile to be hit with arrows, the Monsters sought to kill him by
          trickery. Each took two heavy arrows, swallowed them, and pulled
          them out through their flanks, saying, "Do this and you may
          remain." Locust followed their example, escaping unharmed.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"Now," said he,
          "I did your trick, let me ask you to do one of mine." Then taking
          four sacred arrows he passed them transversely through his chest,
          back and forth, one at a time. As he pulled each arrow out the
          second time he passed it to one of the four Monsters, saying, "If
          you can do this, my people will not come; if not, then I shall send
          for them and we shall all make this our home." Each placed an arrow
          to his chest and pushed, but cringed with pain as soon as it
          penetrated the skin. Fearing the Monsters might not proceed, Locust
          quickly blew toward each of the arrows, which shot through their
          bodies, instantly killing them. In the east now flows Red river,
          made red by the blood of these Monsters; and holes yet remain
          through the thorax of the locust.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Impatient at the
          delay in Locust's return, Badger climbed through the hole in the
          sky and followed the tracks to where Locust had been in controversy
          with the slain Monsters. Seeing their bodies lying out in the
          shallow water, he thought he would go over and inspect them, but he
          sank into the soft black mud, which made him retreat. The mud
          blackened his legs, which have remained the same to this
          day.</p><a name="fig91" id="fig91"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With a large
          stone knife Locust cut off the horns of the Monsters one by one.
          With those from the one toward the east he made a long sweep with
          his arm in that direction, and in the distance sprang up an ocean.
          In like manner he formed oceans to the south, west, and north with
          the horns of the remaining three. The creation of rivers followed:
          with a wave of the hand the Rio Grande, the San Juan, the Colorado,
          the Little Colorado, and others were made. Hair pulled from the
          bodies of the Monsters was tossed to the winds and from it sprang
          frogs, snakes, lizards, and reptiles of every kind.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While Locust was
          doing this the remainder of the people came up. They stood about on
          the small bare spots of ground wondering what to do. Among them
          were the four Winds (Ní̆lchi), Black, Blue, Yellow, and White. Each
          blew toward his respective cardinal point and soon much of the
          water dried up, leaving a quantity of bare land. But not a sign of
          vegetation was there at any hand; all was as barren as the desert
          sands. Luckily each had brought seeds of many kinds from the world
          below. These they began planting, finishing the task in four
          days.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After the
          planting, First Man, First Woman, Wolf Chief, and Mountain Lion
          Chief each made a speech advising the creation of a number of
          mountains similar to the ones they had had in the lower world. This
          was agreeable to all, and accordingly the work was begun. The
          handfuls of earth caught up hurriedly from the tops of the
          mountains below as they were driven off by the rising flood were
          taken to the cardinal points and deposited in the same relative
          positions, an equal distance apart, as were the submerged mountains
          from which the earth had been taken. First Sí̆snajĭnĭ, the White
          Mountain, was<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page091">[pg

          made in the east; then Tsótzĭlh, the Blue Mountain, in the south;
          next Dokóöslit, the Yellow Mountain, in the west, and lastly
          Dĕpé̆nsa, the Black Mountain, in the north. Having yet portions of
          each handful of earth remaining, two more mountains, called Chóĭli
          and Tzĭlhnúhodĭhlĭ, were made near the point of emergence in the
          middle of the rectangle formed by the creation of the other four.
          To give each mountain color, white shell, turquoise, abalone, and
          jet were used for those at the cardinal points, while the middle
          two were colored with a mixture of all these substances.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the
          mountains were finished and the people looked about, it was
          proposed that a sky should be made to cover the earth. "But," said
          one, "what of the earth itself; is it not too small to furnish food
          for the people who shall later come to live upon it?" None had
          thought of this, but reflection, followed by a discussion, brought
          them all to the one opinion—they would enlarge the earth and at the
          same time spread the sky above. Accordingly, the chief who had
          spoken asked if anyone had a piece of turquoise weighing as much as
          a man, and the skin of a large male deer which had been smothered
          to death in pollen. First Man answered that he had. A large white
          shell and the skin of a doe which had been smothered in pollen were
          next requested. First Woman responded with them. The two skins were
          then placed on the ground, side by side, with their heads toward
          the east. Upon the one was put the turquoise and a piece of abalone
          shell; on the other the white shell and a pearl. First Man and
          First Woman then called for Kósdĭlhkĭh, Black Cloud, and Ádĭlhkĭh,
          Black Fog. These came and spread out over the skins four times
          each, lifting and settling each time. When Fog lifted the last time
          it took up with it the skin with the turquoise and abalone and
          began to expand, spreading wider and wider until a blue film
          covered all, in the form of the sky. As the turquoise skin
          expanded, so also did the white-shell skin, broadening the earth as
          it grew. During this period of transition the people all travelled
          eastward, and being Holy People, covered great
          distances<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page092">[pg
          092]</span><a name="Pg092" id="Pg092" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          each day. At the end of the fourth day they stopped. Then also the
          sky and the earth ceased widening, having reached their present
          dimensions. Since the two skins had been placed with their heads
          toward the east, the heads of the sky and the earth are now in that
          direction.</p><a name="fig92" id="fig92"></a>

            God, is the chief character in Navaho mythology. In the rites in
            which personated deities minister to a suffering patient this
            character invariably leads, carrying a four-piece folding wand,
            <span class="tei tei-hi" style="text-align: center"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As yet there was
          neither sun nor moon to shed light, only dawn, circling the horizon
          in the four colors—white in the east, blue in the south, yellow in
          the west, and black in the north. Deeming it necessary that they
          should have light to brighten the world, and warmth for the corn
          and the grass, on their return to the earth's centre one of the
          chiefs made a speech advocating the creation of a sun and a
          moon.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">First Man and
          First Woman placed two sacred deerskins on the ground as before. On
          the buckskin a shell of abalone was placed, on the doeskin a bowl
          made of pearl. The shell contained a piece of clear quartz crystal,
          and the bowl a moss agate. The objects were dressed respectively in
          garments of white, blue, yellow, and black wind, and were carried
          to the end of the land in the east by First Man and First Woman.
          With their spirit power Ástsĕ Hástĭn and Ástsĕ Ĕstsán sent both the
          shell and the bowl far out over the ocean, giving life to the
          crystal and the agate as they did so, directing that the one who
          would be known as Chĕhonaái, the Sun, should journey homeward
          through the sky by day, shedding light and warmth as he passed; the
          other, Klĕhonaái, the Moon, must travel the same course by night.
          To each were given homes of turquoise in the east and west, and
          none but the Winds and the gods, Hasché̆ltĭ and Haschógan, were to
          visit them.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Upon their
          return Ástsĕ Hástĭn and Ástsĕ Ĕstsán were asked if they would leave
          the sky in so plain a condition, or if they intended to beautify it
          with jewels. They replied that it was their intention to dot it
          with many bright stars. All those who had bits of white shell,
          turquoise, crystal, pearl, or abalone were directed to contribute
          them for the making of the stars. These were placed upon the two
          deerskins by First Man and First Woman. The seven stars of the
          Great Dipper, Nôhokos Bakú̆<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "vertical-align: super">n</span></span>,<span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page093">[pg 093]</span><a name="Pg093" id="Pg093" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> were the first to be set in the sky. Next,
          those of Nóhokos Baád, his female complement, were placed in the
          blue dome. Then followed Ĕté̆tso and Ĕtĕtsózĭ, Sóntso and Sontsózĭ,
          and Dílgĕhĕt, the Small Dipper, Sonhótsĭ and Klĕkái Stáĭ, the Milky
          Way.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In each instance
          the arrangement of the stars in the constellation was made when the
          fragments of precious stones were placed upon the skins, where
          Ástsĕ Hástĭn and Ástsĕ Ĕstsán imparted glowing light to them and
          delivered them to the Winds to carry to the sky. Only a small
          portion of the gems had been thus transformed and sent up, when a
          fine-looking, well-dressed stranger came up to watch the
          proceedings. In reply to his question as to what was being done,
          his attention was directed to the sun, the moon, and the many stars
          already created, while more were soon to follow. The man was
          Coyote, son of Darkness. He watched the work for a time, when,
          seeing his chance, he caught the large deerskin containing the pile
          of jewel fragments and flung it skyward, blowing into the bits four
          times ere they could fall, scattering them all over the sky. Thus
          it is that there are myriads of stars irregular in arrangement and
          without names. As he strode off Coyote explained curtly that there
          were already enough sacred things to worship.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then the Winds
          were stationed at the horizon to guard the earth, and at the four
          sacred mountains in the east, south, west, and north, to act as
          messengers for the Hasché̆ltĭ and Haschógan—Talking Gods and House
          Gods—who had their abodes on them. On the same plane, one behind
          the other, the Winds were ranged in streaks, White, Blue, Yellow,
          and Black. Outside of all Coyote placed a streak of Red Wind. This
          forced itself to the inside many years later and gave rise to
          disease and premature death, for as the good Winds are
          life-breathing, so the evil Winds are life-taking. Even now the Red
          Wind takes the lives of many children every year.</p><span class=

            God, here shown. His position among the gods is quite parallel
            with that of peace chief among Indians in life. Like the majority
            of the myth characters he has numerous counterparts in the
            various world quarters.</p>
          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Dĭgí̆n made
          their homes near Chóĭli, close to the place of emergence. It was
          there that all ceremonies took place. From their homes the people
          saw a dark Cloud settle and cover the top of Chóĭli. For four days
          it kept lowering until the mountain was completely shrouded in dark
          blue fog. They did not know whether it portended good or evil, but
          realized that something of moment was at hand. Ástsĕ Hástĭn
          ascended the mountain through the fog to learn what it meant, but
          found nothing unusual. As he turned to descend, a faint, apparently
          distant cry reached his ears, but he paid no heed. Ere long the
          same sound came to him again; then a third and a fourth time,
          whereupon he turned and walked in the direction whence it came. On
          the eastern slope he found a tiny baby, and wrapping it in rays of
          sunbeams he carried it home to his wife.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Cloud that
          descended was a portion of the sky which had come to meet the
          Earth; from the union of the two Yólkai Ĕstsán, White-Shell Woman,
          was born. In twelve days the baby had grown to maturity, subsisting
          on pollen only. Ástsĕ Hástĭn and Ástsĕ Ĕstsán sent messengers to
          all the Dĭgín to tell them of the marvel and to summon them to a
          ceremony which would be held four days later. Word was sent also to
          the gods on the four sacred mountains.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Ástsĕ Ĕstsán
          dressed Yólkai Ĕstsán in fine garments ornamented with beautiful
          jewels. At the western side of her hogán she placed a sacred
          deerskin and laid upon it several wool and cotton blankets,
          covering the whole with a mountain-lion skin. These were arranged
          as the seat of honor for White-Shell Woman, for whom was about to
          be held a ceremony celebrating her maturity.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the appointed
          day all assembled. The first matter to decide was the number of
          songs to be sung. Some wished fourteen, others thought twelve
          sufficient. Hasché̆ltĭ, Talking God, sang the songs and chose to
          sing fourteen. When he had finished, each of the Holy People sang
          six songs, making in all two hundred and eighty-two. An entire
          night was thus consumed. At dawn Ástsĕ Ĕstsán came into the hogán
          with a white-shell bowl containing yucca root, a black <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">tózŭs</span></span>,
          or water bottle,<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page095">[pg
          095]</span><a name="Pg095" id="Pg095" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          containing black rain, and a blue one with blue rain. From each
          bottle she poured a little water upon the yucca root and proceeded
          to wash Yólkai Ĕstsán and all her finery. That done, Yólkai Ĕstsán
          was directed to run toward the rising sun for a short distance and
          return. Many of the young people followed, a chosen singer chanting
          eight songs during their absence. The ceremony finished, the
          assemblage returned to their homes, each of the selected singers
          taking one of the blankets from the seat in return for his
          services.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Although all the
          people then on earth were of the Dĭgí̆n, only a few had god-like
          powers, particularly First Man, First Woman, Yólkai Ĕstsán, and the
          Winds. The lesser Holy Ones worked much in clay, making pottery and
          adobe houses. The designs they used in their earthenware, however,
          were of a sacred nature, to be used only in ceremonials, and when
          the Fox, Wolf, Badger, Bird, and many other people repeatedly
          employed sacred symbols to adorn their cooking pots, First Man and
          his wife became very angry and called a council, which, in addition
          to themselves, was attended by Chĕhonaái, Yólkai Ĕstsán, and
          Ní̆lchi, the Wind People.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The wicked
          people had homes throughout the land, many of which were built of
          stone, upon the plains, and others in the cliffs. The councillors
          decided that these people and their homes must be destroyed, but
          how to effect this was a problem.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">First Woman and
          Chĕhonaái thought it would be wise to give birth to demoniac
          monsters and let them devour the evil ones, but First Man objected,
          and finally the council agreed that the Winds should perform the
          task by bringing forth a devastating storm. The faithful were
          warned and given time to seek refuge under the water, inside the
          sacred mountains, in the higher cliffs, and in the sky. Then the
          Winds came. For four days terrific storms raged, hurling men and
          trees and houses through the air like leaves. When they abated
          hundreds of houses lay<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page096">[pg
          096]</span><a name="Pg096" id="Pg096" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          in ruins which may yet be traced by heaps of stones scattered
          throughout the Navaho country.</p><a name="fig94" id="fig94"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Soon another
          council of the same dictators was called, this time to discuss how
          more people might be created. First Man sent Wind messengers to
          bring Black Fog Boy and Black Cloud Girl, Precious Stone Boy and
          Precious Stone Girl, White Corn Boy and Yellow Corn Girl, Blue Corn
          Boy and All-Color Corn Girl, Pollen Boy and Cricket Girl, and Rain
          Boy and Rain Girl. These twelve were laid side by side on four
          sacred deerskins and covered with four others. The Spirit Winds of
          the west came and blew between the skins; the Spirit Winds of the
          east came and blew also; then came Hasché̆ltĭ from the east, with
          rainbows in his hand, calling "Wu-hu-hu-hu-u"; and Haschógan from
          the south, with sunbeams in his hand. They walked up and gently
          tapped the skins with their bows and beams. Hasché̆ltĭ of the west
          and Haschógan of the north came next and gently tapped the skins.
          Then the skins lifted, revealing twelve beautiful young people
          perfectly formed. Ástsĕ Hástĭn bade them arise and stand, and then
          with Hasché̆ltĭ in the lead and Haschógan behind, they four times
          encircled the sacred mountains Chóĭli and Tzĭlhnúhodĭhlĭ, halting
          close to the hole whence the Holy People emerged. There Ástsĕ
          Hástĭn made them an extended speech, telling them that they had
          been brought forth from the elements to people the earth; that they
          must rear children and care for them as kind fathers and mothers,
          teaching them to be good to one another; and that it would be
          necessary for them to plant corn and other seeds at once. The
          Dĭgí̆n, First Man continued, were about to leave, to go into the
          rivers, the oceans, the cliffs, the mountains, off to the horizon,
          and to the sky, but they would ever keep watch over their people
          and would help those who showed them respect and reverence in
          prayer and song. To Yólkai Ĕstsán was entrusted future guardianship
          of the people. It would be her duty to furnish the he-rain and the
          she-rain, to fructify all crops, and bring forth abundant grass and
          seeds.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then the Dĭgí̆n
          took their departure, vanishing the people knew not whither. Yólkai
          Ĕstsán turned westward to her whiteshell<span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page097">[pg 097]</span><a name="Pg097" id="Pg097" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> home on the horizon, far out across the wide
          waters. Arriving there she determined to make a few more people.
          Cuticle rubbed from her body, with bits of white shell, turquoise,
          abalone, and jet, she placed between two sacred deerskins, male and
          female, and called for the Spirit Winds of the east, the Spirit
          Winds of the west, Hasché̆ltĭ and Haschógan, who came and breathed
          upon and tapped the deerskins as once before, and lo! there arose
          four pairs of people.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Each pair was
          given a walking-stick—one of white shell to one, staffs of
          turquoise, abalone, and jet respectively to the others. Black Fog
          and Black Cloud came and spread out over the water. Upon these the
          new people took up their journey eastward to join others like
          themselves. For four days they travelled on Fog and Cloud, reaching
          the earth at the end of the fourth day, where, on the following
          day, they were welcomed by Chĕhonaái, the Sun. There, too, the
          Bear, the Wolf, the Great Snake, the Mountain Lion, the Weasel, and
          the Porcupine met them at the direction of Yólkai Ĕstsán, to guard
          them on their long land journey. The Lightning also she made, to
          protect them from above.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They journeyed
          eastward, stopping to camp and rest at the end of the first day.
          For water they had but to prod the earth with their walking-sticks
          and a spring gushed forth. The first of the four, the man of White
          Shell, stuck his staff into the ground and water came up at once.
          "The water is close," he remarked, from which speech he took his
          name, for the others henceforth called him To Ahánĭ, Water Is
          Close. The following night the Turquoise Woman brought water, but
          it was bitter, so she said, from which fact she took her name of To
          Dĭchínĭ, Bitter Water. The man who tried for water on the third
          night found only a muddy flow, so the others called him
          Hashklí̆shnĭ, Mud. The fourth night they camped in sight of the
          Dĭné̆ (Navaho) whom they had come to join. The woman of the fourth
          pair called attention to the houses in the caves, after which they
          called her Kí̆nya Ánĭ, Houses in the Cliffs.<a id="noteref_7" name=

            important characters in Navaho mythology are twin
            miracle-performing sons of White-Shell Woman, Yólkai Ĕstsán,
            chief goddess. This plate pictures the leader of the two—the
            first conceived and the first-born, whose father is the sun. His
            name means "Slayer of Alien Gods," from <span class="tei tei-hi"
            style="text-align: center"><span style=

            the assistance of Tobadzĭschí̆nĭ, his twin brother, were killed
            numerous bird, animal, rock, and human monsters, typifying evils,
            who wantonly destroyed human life.</p>
          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the Spirit
          People came upon this earth from below they made six sacred
          mountains, four on the distant horizon at the cardinal points and
          two in the centre, Chóĭli and Tzĭlhnúhodĭíhlĭ. On the eastern slope
          of Chóĭli, brought forth as the daughter of Earth and Sky, was born
          Yólkai Estsán, White-Shell Woman. First Man took her to his home
          near Tzĭlhnúhodĭhlĭ, where she matured in twelve days into a
          beautiful woman with supernatural powers. Later she lived in a home
          of her own at the foot of this mountain. It was while there that
          she gave birth to twin boys who became saviours of their people,
          slaying alien gods who were fast depopulating the earth.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Yólkai Estsán
          would often lie on the eastern slope of the mountain as the sun
          rose through the morning, and when the day grew warm would seek the
          shade of jutting rocks from which trickled shining drops of water.
          Quite unknown to herself she had conceived one day from the
          sunbeams and the dripping water. When she became aware that she was
          to become a mother Yólkai Ĕstsán was made very happy, for she did
          not enjoy living alone. Soon she found herself the proud possessor
          of twin boys. The first-born and the stronger came to be known in
          his youth as Nayé̆nĕzganĭ, Slayer of Alien Gods; the other was
          always known as Tobadzĭschí̆nĭ, Born From Water. Their prenatal
          life covered a period of only twelve days, and maturity was
          attained in thirty-two days after passing through eight changes,
          one of which came every four days.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At that time the
          earth was infested with great giants, foreign gods, who were
          rapidly destroying the people. Of these, Yéĭtso, Big God, as large
          as a mountain, was the only one in human<span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page099">[pg 099]</span><a name="Pg099" id="Pg099" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> form. The others were Man-eating Bird,
          Rolling Stone, that crushed all in its path, Tracking Bear, and
          Antelope, who killed without mercy. Fearing lest some of these
          monsters learn of the presence of her boys, Yólkai Ĕstsán kept them
          hidden away on the mountain side, but they chafed under
          confinement, so she made them bows and arrows and let them play
          about, but admonished them not to stray far from home. The boys
          promised to obey, but not long afterward, because in reply to their
          questions their mother told them she did not know who their father
          was, they became sulky and broke their promise, going off toward
          the east. They would go and search for someone who knew. When on a
          small knoll a long way from home they heard a whispered "Sh-h."</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"Are you afraid,
          my younger brother?" asked Nayé̆nĕzganĭ.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"No!" was the
          quick response.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Four times they
          heard the whisper, and then two of the Wind People appeared. "We
          saw you travelling eastward," said they, "and came to caution you.
          The land is cursed with alien gods who kill for pleasure; beware of
          them! Why do you journey thus alone without your father?"</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"Our father!
          Alas, we know nothing of him and are now starting on a search to
          learn. Do you know who he is?" asked the boys.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"Yes, the Sun is
          your father; but if you think to find him you will have to travel
          far eastward and cross the wide, wide waters."</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nayé̆nĕzganĭ
          turned to his younger brother and said, "Sítsĭlĭ, let us go."</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Sun was then
          overhead. Being in fact of a holy nature, the boys covered distance
          rapidly and by mid-afternoon had passed well beyond the limits of
          their homeland. There they<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page100">[pg
          100]</span><a name="Pg100" id="Pg100" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          came upon an old woman sitting beside a ladder projecting from a
          hole. She asked them who they were and whither they were going.
          They told her to the Sun, whose sons they were, but whom they had
          never seen.</p><a name="fig98" id="fig98"></a>

            "text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1.00em">This is Born From
            Water, the second of the twin miracle-performing sons of Yólkai
            Ĕstsán, the White-Shell Woman. His brother is Nayé̆nĕzganĭ.</p>
          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"I pity you, my
          grandchildren," said the old woman; "come in here and rest a moment
          before going on." She started down the ladder and the boys
          followed. Twelve ladders were descended before her home was
          reached. The old woman was Spider Woman, the little grandmother who
          belonged to the Holy Ones. Her home was well kept, clean and
          comfortable, and the boys were glad to rest. Said she, "My
          grandchildren, your journey is long and many trials will beset you
          before you reach the end. Take these life feathers; they will help
          you; if difficulties befall you, use them," and she gave to each
          two feathers plucked from a living eagle.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The boys took
          the feathers, thanked her, and resumed their journey. After
          travelling a long way they came to a ridge of loose, yellow sand.
          It afforded poor footing for an ascent, but the boys struggled to
          the top, only to have the whole side of the ridge slide and carry
          them back. Three times the bank gave way as they were about to
          reach its crest; on the fourth trial they bethought themselves of
          the sacred feathers, and putting them on their feet marched readily
          over.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They travelled
          unimpeded then for quite a long distance, in time coming to four
          rows of tall, thorny reeds with spiked branches. The reeds grew far
          enough apart to permit travellers to pass into them, but closed
          whenever the unwary allowed himself to be caught, and he never
          escaped. The boys marched boldly up to the reeds and started in,
          then darted back quickly. The reeds closed instantly, but did not
          catch them. Then they put the life feathers on their feet again and
          jumped over all four rows.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The next
          obstacle was a deep cañon with precipitous walls. This, however,
          was not a serious impediment, for the life feathers, as before,
          helped them to cross it in one bound. By nightfall the boys had
          arrived at a broad, beautiful meadow where lived the Wósakĭdĭ, or
          Grasshopper People, who received them kindly,<span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page101">[pg 101]</span><a name="Pg101" id="Pg101"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> giving them food and beds for the
          night. On being asked whither they were bound, the boys replied
          that they were journeying to the home of the Sun, their father,
          whom they had never seen.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Wósakĭdĭ
          cautioned the boys of dangers ahead, and as they were about to
          depart in the morning gave them little balls of yellow sputum to
          put in their mouths to prevent poisoning, should they find it
          necessary to eat or smoke among hostile people, and two sacred
          wands of turquoise and white shell. Two of the Wósakĭdĭ also
          accompanied them for a time as guides.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They had not
          been long on their way when they came to a place where the trail
          ran between two high, smooth-faced bowlders. "These," said their
          Wósakĭdĭ companions, "are the Bumping Rocks. If you step into that
          narrow passageway between them they will crash together and kill
          you." The boys started as if to enter, but fell back. The huge
          rocks came violently together, but did no harm. The feint was made
          three times, and each time the rocks crashed together and bounded
          back. The fourth time the boys entered they placed their sacred
          wands of turquoise and white shell across the gap above their heads
          and passed through, for these held the bowlders apart. As they
          emerged on the opposite side they saw the Sun rising from his
          eastern home and he was yet far away.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Soon a wide
          stretch of water was encountered; so far as they could see there
          was nothing but water. Here again they used their life feathers and
          were carried safely over. Four successive stretches of water and
          land were crossed, and still a fifth sheet of water lay before
          them. Along its shores paddled many varieties of animals. The boys
          looked out across the deep and could discern away out in the centre
          a house of turquoise and white shell, its roof glistening in the
          sunlight. Certain that it must be the home of their father, they
          readjusted their life feathers to start across, but found that they
          had lost control over them. They tried them several times in
          different places, but to no avail.<span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page102">[pg 102]</span><a name="Pg102" id="Pg102" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> The thought of not reaching their father's
          house when so near filled their hearts with bitter disappointment.
          Seemingly there was naught that they could do, but they sat and
          pondered.</p><a name="fig99" id="fig99"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As they sat
          there in silence, Snipe Man, a little old fellow, came to them and
          asked, "Where do you go, my grandchildren?"</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"To the home of
          the Sun," the boys replied.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"Do you know
          anyone there?"</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"Yes," said
          they, "the Sun is our father." Thereupon Snipe Man placed a rainbow
          bridge across the water and told them to pass on, first warning
          them against two large Bears, the Lightning, Snakes, and Wind, who
          guarded the home of the Sun. They crossed over the rainbow bridge,
          which took them almost to the door of the house, and there they
          were met by the Bears with bristling coats. Nayé̆nĕzganĭ spoke to
          them, saying, "I am the child of Yólkai Ĕstsán." They let him pass.
          Tobadzĭschí̆nĭ uttered the same words and passed on also. The same
          words took the boys past the Lightning, the Snakes, and the Wind,
          and they entered the house, going through four doorways before
          coming to the living-rooms in the interior.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There they found
          an elderly woman, radiantly beautiful, with two handsome boys and
          girls, the like of whom they had never seen. They stood transfixed
          as if in a dream until the voice of the beautiful woman, who was
          the wife of the Sun, startled them, demanding to know how they
          dared to enter a sacred place forbidden to all save the Dĭgí̆n.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nayé̆nĕzganĭ
          replied, saying, "This is the end of our journey. We came to see
          our father, the Sun and this we are told is his home."</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The wife raged
          with anger, making dire threats against her husband if what the
          boys asserted were true, which she did not doubt since they had
          found it possible to gain entrance to her home. Could it be that he
          was the father of many of whom she knew nothing? She would find
          out. Surely he must have smiled upon most ugly creatures if these
          two boys were his sons!</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was about
          time for the Sun to return. As his wife thought of what he might do
          to the boys, her anger turned to compassion,<span class=

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and she bade them wrap themselves in
          the clouds that hung on the wall, and hide. Ere long a great rattle
          was heard outside, and a moment later the Sun came striding in and
          hung up his glistening shield. "What strangers are here?" he asked.
          There was no answer. Again he asked the question, repeating it a
          third time and a fourth, waxing angry. Then his wife began to
          scold. She told him that two boys of his, the ugliest creatures she
          had ever looked upon, had come to see their father, and demanded to
          know what it meant. "Where are they?" asked the Sun; but his wife
          did not reply to the question; instead she kept on scolding. The
          Sun looked about, and noting a change in the clouds that hung upon
          the western wall, took them down and unfolded them, until he
          discovered Nayé̆nĕzganĭ and Tobadzĭschí̆nĭ.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Sun became
          angrier than ever and determined to have done with the trouble at
          once by killing the boys. From the eastern wall of the room
          projected numerous sharp spikes of white shell. There were
          turquoise spikes in the southern, abalone in the western, and jet
          in the northern walls. The boys were each hurled against the first
          of these, but dropped to the floor unharmed; then against the
          second, the third, and the fourth, with a like result. On the floor
          near the walls sat four large mortars with heavy pestles in them.
          The boys were placed in each of these successively and pounded, as
          their father thought, into fragments, but out of this also they
          came unharmed.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Sun then
          waved them to a seat and brought forth four large pipes, two of
          abalone and two of lignite. He handed two of each to the boys,
          saying, "I wish you to have a good smoke."</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"Beware!"
          whispered the Wind. "His tobacco is poisoned!"</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The boys deftly
          sought the little balls they had received from the Wósakĭdĭ,
          slipped them into their mouths, and began puffing. When the first
          pipefuls were finished they laid the pipes on the floor and picked
          up the other two, showing no sign of distress.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Seeing that the
          poison tobacco was having no effect on the youthful strangers, the
          Sun sent for Haschógan and Hasché̆zhĭnĭ,<span class="tei tei-pb"

          build a sweat-house and heat large stones as hot as they could be
          made, so that they might burst into fragments and fill the
          sweat-lodge with scalding steam when water was poured upon them. By
          the time the boys had finished their second pipes, which proved as
          harmless as the others, the little house and heated stones were
          ready. Haschógan made the lodge of stone and covered it with earth,
          erecting double walls on the northern side with a space between,
          into which he provided an entrance from the inside, concealed with
          a flat stone slab.</p><a name="fig100" id="fig100"></a>

            personation of the Navaho God of Harvest. The name signifies
            "Hunchback." He is represented always in a stooping posture,
            carrying a staff to aid him in supporting a burden of corn, bean,
            pumpkin, and other seeds which he carries upon his back. The
            personation is conventional, rather than literal, in intent.</p>
          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Sun looked
          into the lodge, saw that it was tight, and told the boys to enter.
          As they passed in Haschógan whispered, "Get behind the stone slab
          on the north!" Then Hasché̆zhĭnĭ rolled in several red-hot bowlders
          and closed the entrance tightly with heavy cloud blankets. White,
          blue, yellow, and black water was then thrown in, and there
          followed the sounds of the sizzling steam and bursting stones;
          fragments could be heard striking the walls on all sides. After a
          short while the boys heard the voice of their father call out from
          the east, "Are you warm?" They gave no response. He called again
          from the south, but received no answer; then from the west; all was
          silence. "Surely I am rid of them at last," thought he. He called
          once again from the north, and to his great surprise received a
          reply. The sweat-house had cooled enough to permit the boys to
          emerge from their hiding-place, so their cheerful voices came from
          near the doorway.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"These must be
          my sons," thought the Sun, and throwing back the blankets from the
          door he embraced them. "My children, whence came you and how did
          you get here?"</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The story of
          their home at Tzĭlhnúhodĭhlĭ, of their long journey across land and
          water, and of the many obstacles encountered, was soon told. Then
          the Sun directed his wife and daughters to remould the boys and
          make them as handsome as themselves. When that was done all entered
          the house, where on the walls hung many beautiful strings of
          turquoise, abalone, white-shell, and jet beads, and plates of
          armor. These were<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page105">[pg
          105]</span><a name="Pg105" id="Pg105" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          offered to the boys, but they refused them, saying they cared not
          for jewels, preferring instead to have lightning arrows, strong
          bows, and heavy knives with which to battle with the giant alien
          gods who were destroying people in all parts of the earth. The Sun
          gave them the weapons desired, and when it came time to resume his
          journey across the sky he took his newfound sons with him.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Near Tsótzĭlh,
          the sacred mountain of the south, lived Yéĭtso, the Big God. The
          boys wished to try their skill on him first, so their father let
          them down from the sky upon that mountain. The giant was drinking
          from a lake and saw the reflection of his new enemies as they
          dropped upon the mountain. He straightened up quickly and sent an
          arrow aimed for the body of Nayé̆nĕzganĭ, but the boy dodged
          quickly and responded with a bolt of lightning which stripped the
          armor from Yéĭtso's feet. Three more shafts of lightning struck the
          armor from the hips, body, and head of this fiercest of giants,
          exposing his vitals to the attack of the boys, who filled him with
          arrows, killing him instantly. The Big God's blood began to flow
          down a cañon. Nayé̆nĕzganĭ drew a line across its path with his
          stone knife, and the blood ceased flowing onward, rising in a wall
          across the cañon's head, over which now plunges a beautiful
          waterfall.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The brothers
          then set off for home, taking the heart of their slain enemy with
          them. Arriving at Tzĭlhnúhodĭhlĭ they found their mother in tears,
          for she was certain that her boys had been killed and devoured by
          monsters. Though unchanged in size, so altered were they in
          appearance that Yólkai Ĕstsán could not believe them to be her own
          boys whom she was mourning as dead, but the story of their
          adventures from the time they had left home was soon told, and all
          rejoiced.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the days
          following, Nayé̆nĕzganĭ and Tobadzĭschí̆nĭ made incursions into the
          lands of the alien gods, killing them all and freeing the earth
          from the dread and curse of these man-killing<span class=

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> monsters. The first to meet destruction
          at their hands when they took up their deliberate search for giants
          was Déĭlgĕt, Giant Antelope, who had great blue horns upon which he
          tossed people to death. The next accosted was Tsĕ Nahálĭ, the
          preying Mountain Eagle, and soon after they sought and killed
          Tsĕtahídzĭlhtúhlĭ, Among The Rocks He Kicks Them Down The Mountain.
          Then Bĭnáyeaganĭ, Who Kills With His Eyes, met death, followed
          shortly after by Tsé̆agai, Rolling Bowlder, and Sŭsh Nalkái,
          Tracking Bear, the last to lose their lives at the hands of the
          youthful warriors, Nayé̆nĕzganĭ and Tobadzĭschínĭ, who have since
          remained the War Gods of the Navaho.</p>

            The personator of this god in the ceremonies assumes the

            principally of spruce boughs and a mask.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Hozhónĭ
          Hatál, or Happiness Chant, is a nine-days' chant held inside a
          hogán, and like many of the Navaho ceremonies, it was derived from
          another tribe. The myth relating to it tells of a renowned warrior
          who had two beautiful sisters whom he wished to see married, but
          only to men who should first prove their strength and valor in a
          feat of arms; so word was sent to all the young men of the
          warrior's tribe to gather at his home on a certain day, prepared
          for war, if they wished to enter a contest he would then propose.
          The girls being coveted prizes, a goodly number of warriors,
          painted and dressed in full war regalia, assembled on the appointed
          day, among them being two old, white-haired brothers, of an alien
          tribe, who had recently come to live near the Navaho people. The
          young chief protested at the presence of the old men, declaring
          that they would only sacrifice their lives in the first combat, for
          they could have no possible hope of success. The two persisted,
          however, and were allowed to remain in the van.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Four-days
          journey from the Navaho country was a village of the Áya Kĭnné̆,
          Have Holes For Houses, enemies from early times. They also prided
          themselves on having two very beautiful girls, upon whom many
          admiring young men of the tribe bestowed valuable presents of
          turquoise, shell beads, and other jewels. One<span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page107">[pg 107]</span><a name="Pg107" id="Pg107"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of these wondrous beauties wore her
          hair plaited always with rich strings of turquoise; the other with
          strings of white shell.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"To the two
          men," said the vaunting young Navaho, "who will fight their way to
          the homes of these boasted beauties and bring to me their
          jewel-plaited scalps, will I give my sisters."</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The band
          started, each man eager and hopeful, and on the fourth night
          bivouacked in sight of the cliffs under which the hated Áya Kĭnné̆
          had their homes. At daybreak on the following morning they made
          their attack on the pueblo, but the villagers, ever alert and well
          prepared for an onslaught, offered desperate resistance, every man
          fighting bravely for his life and his family. All day long the
          contest raged; arrow, lance, and stone hammer dealing death on
          every hand. As nightfall shrouded the combatants in darkness, the
          invaders, depleted in rank, slunk back to their camp on the hill,
          where they found the two gray-haired brothers, each bearing a
          jewelled scalp as his trophy.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the Navaho
          chief learned that the old men were the victors, he raged with
          anger, condemning his tribesmen and vowing that his sisters should
          never become the wives of unknown aliens, and accordingly declared
          a new contest. The man who would win a beautiful wife must hit the
          blade of a yucca plant with an arrow at forty paces. The long,
          narrow blade was hung in the bark of a tree and the contest
          commenced. The younger men shot first. One by one they twanged
          their bows, and one by one marched off in sullen humor. At last it
          came the turn of the aged brothers. The first shot his arrow, and
          the slender leaf was pierced; the second shot, and again the leaf
          was pierced; but so soon as the second arrow had hit its mark the
          Navaho declared a new feat, contending that this had not been
          sufficient. A long race was then arranged, and once more the
          brothers came off victorious.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The chief became
          desperate. Some feat must be devised in which his own men could
          prove the superior. In the wall of a high cliff not far distant was
          a small hole, barely larger than a half-closed hand, and just above
          the reach of the average man. The ones who could run past that
          hole, jump, and thrust their hands into it as they did so, might
          claim the sisters. One by one the young Navaho warriors leaped
          wildly and struck out for the hole in the cliff, but none could
          thrust his hand into it. Then the elderly brothers ran past, sprang
          lightly, and darted a hand each into the pocket.</p><a name=

            whose abode is in the water, are supposed to have peculiar
            markings about their mouths. Rescue from drowning invariably
            redounds to the glory of these gods.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But for the
          third time the Navaho chief declared the test insufficient. The
          cliff was high. They who would marry his sisters must shoot an
          arrow over its rim; so a second contest in archery took place, but
          only the feathered reeds of the white-haired brothers passed out of
          sight.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Still the old
          men were refused the prizes they had fairly won so many times. A
          dance was called. Finding no way to outdo the two brothers in skill
          or strength, the young chief left the selection of husbands to his
          sisters. They should join the men in the dance and go home with
          whom they chose. The aliens did not join the dancers, preferring
          instead to remain in their own little brush house half a mile
          distant, with its single-slant roof, "For it is foolish," said one,
          "to think that two such handsome young maidens as they are would
          ever look with favor upon our rags and wrinkles. We would better
          lie here to-night and rest in sleep after our busy day." Each then
          brought forth a sacred pipe and tobacco, which they used only on
          rare occasions. One had a pipe of rich blue turquoise, and the
          other one of fine, pure white shell. They filled them, smoking in
          silence. From the distance the songs and laughter of the merry
          dancers greeted their ears, but not as joyous sounds. Each smoked
          with apparent resolution, blowing forth cloud after cloud of filmy
          whiteness, and lo! as they smoked each noticed that the other had
          grown youthful in appearance! Their tattered garments, too, as
          insensibly as the creeping shadows, changed their forms, becoming
          fine shirts, leggings, and moccasins.</p><span class="tei tei-pb"

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the dance the
          younger sister asked, "What is it that smells so sweet?"</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"I have noticed
          nothing," the other replied.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"Come over here
          and face the breeze," said the first; and there, sure enough, came
          wafts of air sweet and savory. Neither had ever before scented
          anything so pleasing, and they determined to follow the aroma
          against the breeze. The moon shed ample light to guide their
          footsteps, and once locating the true direction whence the wind
          came, the two had no difficulty in threading their way straight to
          the home of the brothers who had vanquished so many rivals in so
          many feats. Knowing nothing of the men, other than that they were
          strangers from an alien tribe, the girls were somewhat startled at
          coming so boldly face to face with them; but a moment's hesitation
          gave them assurance, for surely, they thought, such finely dressed,
          handsome men could mean no harm.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Said one: "What
          it was we did not know, so came to determine if we could; but the
          most delicious odor we ever smelled seemed to fill the air about us
          at the dance, coming always from this direction, and now we see
          that it was the smoke of your tobacco. It must be a wonderful land,
          where you come from, if tobacco like that grows there."</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"That you may
          see for yourselves," answered the elder brother, "for we have come
          to take you there if you will but consent to go. Our land is rich
          in jewels and possesses a soil that grows bountiful crops of many
          kinds, some of which you have never seen. Marry us and you shall
          live always in abundance."</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The girls
          consented, and at bedtime retired with their husbands for the
          night, only to waken in the morning, however, to a sense of horror;
          for whom should they find beside them but the two grim-visaged old
          men so cordially hated by all their tribe! They dared not to
          display their fear and horror before the men, who were quite awake,
          though feigning sleep, but each read the<span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page110">[pg 110]</span><a name="Pg110" id="Pg110" class=

          they? Where had they been? Had they merely dreamed of meeting two
          handsome, well-clad strangers in the night? Slowly their memories
          came back—the last shooting contest, the preparation for the dance,
          the songs and feasting, the enchanting perfumed breezes, and their
          quest—they remembered now. But how this change in their companions?
          They were strangers, and unquestionably magicians who could
          transform themselves or work spells on others! With this thought
          the desire for vengeance increased with every
          pulse-beat.</p><a name="fig105" id="fig105"></a>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style=
            "text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Navaho mythology
            there are numerous references to benevolent female deities, who
            are personated in medicine rites by men wearing masks, as shown
            in this plate. Haschĕbaád may be translated "female deity," or
            "goddess."</p>
          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The day wore on
          before the women had a chance to talk together apart from their
          husbands, when they agreed that they would return to their home and
          tell their brother of the evil worked upon them by the old men,
          whom they would then soon see killed; but the Little Whirlwind
          whispered to them, "Return not to your home; anger fills the hearts
          of all your people, and it is you who would be killed with clubs
          and stones." Thwarted in this plan, they determined to leave and
          search for a distant tribe of which they had once heard, that lived
          in peace, and had never led the life of marauders. There, surely,
          they might receive food and shelter and freedom from the sorcery of
          their husbands. Each would take a separate course upon starting, to
          meet at a wooded mountain in the east.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All went well
          throughout the day; the old men rested and made ready for the
          journey to their home-land, on which they planned to start at
          daybreak. That night the women did not sleep. When their husbands
          became wrapt in slumber, they quietly crawled out from their furs,
          snatched a little food, and glided into the moonlight. They had
          been gone but a short time when one of the old men arose to stir
          the fire, and in deep surprise noted the absence of the women. He
          called his brother, and the two held a hurried consultation. They
          circled the lodge, but in the dimness of the light could discern no
          guiding footprint to tell the direction in which their young wives
          had gone. Returning to the camp, they filled their sacred pipes,
          and in silence sat and smoked. Soon a thin curl of smoke was
          seen<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page111">[pg 111]</span><a name=
          "Pg111" id="Pg111" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> drifting southward,
          winding in and out among the piñons; then another on the north
          side. These they followed, bearing eastward, smoking as they went,
          and as the sun began to tint the higher hills and mountain crests
          with yellow, bathing all else in purple shadows, they came upon
          their wives in a little rocky cañon screened by thickly growing
          cedar and piñon. The smoke foretold the women of their doom, so
          they were not taken by surprise.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Seeing no way to
          escape, the girls resigned themselves to fate, and meekly followed
          the old men back to camp, whence they journeyed with them to the
          west.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At their home
          the brothers had wives and children, so they did not herald their
          new consorts as such, but wedded them at once to their eldest sons.
          This prospect pleased the two young women, and they entered into
          the spirit of the new life with zest. They learned the songs and
          chants of the rites of the Snake and the Bear people—the clans to
          which these younger husbands belonged—and taught them to a young
          brother who came to visit them. When the brother returned to the
          Navaho people, he told them that his sisters were quite happy, and
          with the songs he had learned from them he originated the Hozhónĭ
          Hatál, Happiness Chant.</p>

          three brothers—the eldest rich, the second a wayward, roving
          gambler, and the youngest a mere boy—lived together among their
          kind, the Dĭné̆ people. Their only sister was married, living apart
          with her husband. The gambler often took property belonging to his
          brothers, going to distant corners of the land to stake it on games
          of chance. On returning, he never failed to relate a story of
          wonders he had seen—the Holy People whom he had met, and who
          revealed many things to him.<span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One day they
          wished to go hunting, but did not want The Dreamer to accompany
          them, so, going to the home of their brother-in-law, they told him
          of their purpose, and all three stole away. As the sun began its
          descent on the fourth day, it occurred to Bĭlh Ahatí̆nĭ that he had
          been tricked, so he started in search of the hunters, hoping to
          meet them returning, that he might help them carry their game and
          be rewarded with a pelt or two. He travelled far, but had not come
          upon them when the sun passed behind the distant hills. Near by was
          a deep, rock-walled cañon, from the depths of which many mingled
          voices could be heard. Bĭlh Ahatí̆nĭ walked to its edge and peered
          over. Back and forth from side to side flew countless crows,
          passing in and out of dark holes in opposite walls. From below,
          when darkness had shrouded all, Bĭlh Ahatí̆nĭ heard a human voice
          call in loud echoing tones, "They say, they say, they say, they
          say!"</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From the far
          side came the answer: "Yes, yes! What's the matter now? What's the
          matter now?"</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"Two people were
          killed to-day," continued the voice just below.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"Who were they?
          Who were they?"</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To which the
          first voice answered, "Anahailí̆hĭ, killed at sunrise, and
          Igákĭzhĭ, killed at dusk, by the People of the Earth. They went in
          search of meat, and the hunters shot arrows into them. We are
          sorry, but they were told to be careful and did not heed. It is too
          late to help them now; let us go on with the chant."</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It had grown
          very dark, and Bĭlh Ahatí̆nĭ became greatly frightened, but he
          stayed to listen and watch. Muffled strains of songs came from the
          deep recesses in each cañon wall,—the gods were singing—and just
          within the openings, discernible in the glow of a fire, could be
          seen many dancers performing in unison as they kept time with
          rattles. Throughout the night firelight flickered from wall to wall
          and singing and dancing<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page113">[pg
          113]</span><a name="Pg113" id="Pg113" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          continued. At daylight the participants departed in all directions,
          so Bĭlh Ahatí̆nĭ resumed the quest of the hunters.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He had travelled
          but a short time when he came upon his brothers, resting their
          heavy game packs on their journey homeward.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"Here comes The
          Dreamer," spoke his elder brother. "I will wager he has something
          marvellous to relate."</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Bĭlh Ahatí̆nĭ
          was greeted first by his brother-in-law. "You must have slept near
          here last night, for you are too far out to have made this distance
          since daylight."</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"I did," he
          replied, "near a cañon that is surely holy. A lot of people had
          gathered to dance, the gods sang, and—"</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"There, I told
          you he would have some lie to tell," interrupted the eldest
          brother, and started on.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"Go ahead,"
          urged the brother-in-law; "tell us the rest."</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"It's no use; no
          one cares to listen to me," said Bĭlh Ahatí̆nĭ.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His younger
          brother, also incredulous, took up his burden and plodded off,
          whereat Bĭlh Ahatí̆nĭ related all that he had seen and heard.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"You men must
          have killed those people they spoke about," he accused.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"No, it was none
          of us," his brother-in-law protested; "we have killed no people.
          Yesterday morning one shot a crow, and last night we killed a
          magpie, but there was no harm in that."</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"I fear there
          was; they were hunters like yourselves, in search of meat for the
          Holy People, for the time disguised as birds," Bĭlh Ahatí̆nĭ
          ventured. Then, dividing the pack, the two hurried on to overtake
          the others.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"Well," asked
          the youngest, "did you hear a fine story?"</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"It is not a
          lie," his brother-in-law retorted; "we killed a crow and a magpie
          yesterday, and the Holy People talked about it in the cañon last
          night. Look! There come four mountain<span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page114">[pg 114]</span><a name="Pg114" id="Pg114" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> sheep! Hurry, Bĭlh Ahatí̆nĭ and head them
          off!" They had come upon the cañon where the strange voices had
          been heard. Four sheep, among large bowlders near the rim, were
          carefully threading their way out of it. The three dropped back,
          while Bĭlh Ahatí̆nĭ ran ahead and concealed himself near the
          ascending trail. As the sheep approached he drew his bow and aimed
          for the leader's heart, but his fingers could not loose their grip
          upon the arrow, and the sheep passed by unharmed. Bĭlh Ahatí̆nĭ
          scrambled up over the rim of the cañon and ran to get ahead of them
          again, but the bowstring would not leave his fingers as they
          passed. A third effort, and a fourth, to kill the game brought the
          same result. Bĭlh Ahatí̆nĭ cursed himself and the sheep, but ceased
          suddenly, for whom should he see but four gods, Yébĭchai, appear
          before him, who had transformed themselves into sheep! Hasché̆ltĭ,
          in the lead, ran up to him and dropped his <span class=

          you?" Bĭlh Ahatí̆nĭ asked them.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"From
          Kĭnní̆nĭkai," Hasché̆ltĭ answered.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"Whither are you
          going?"</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"To Tsé̆gyiĭ, to
          hold another <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          had better come along."</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"No, I couldn't
          travel so far in four days."</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But after a
          little parleying Bĭlh Ahatí̆nĭ assented. He was told to disrobe,
          and doing so Gá<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "vertical-align: super">n</span></span>askĭdĭ breathed upon him,
          and his raiment became the same as that of the gods. Then all took
          four steps eastward, changing into mountain sheep, and bounded away
          along the cañon's rim.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The hunters in
          hiding became restless as The Dreamer did not return, so ventured
          out where they could view the trail on which he was last seen. No
          one was in sight. One went to the rock where Bĭlh Ahatí̆nĭ first
          hid near the sheep and followed his tracks from hiding place to
          hiding place until the fourth one was reached, and there he found
          his brother's old clothes with his bow and arrows upon them. There
          he traced<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page115">[pg
          115]</span><a name="Pg115" id="Pg115" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          four human footsteps to the east that merged into the trail of five
          mountain sheep. The eldest brother cried in his remorse, for he saw
          that his brother was holy, and he had always treated him with
          scorn.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The gods and
          Bĭlh Ahatí̆nĭ, transformed to mountain sheep, travelled very far
          during their four days' journey, coming on the fourth day to a
          large hogán. Inside were numerous Holy People, both gods and men.
          When Bĭlh Ahatí̆nĭ entered with his four holy companions, a
          complaint at once arose from those inside against an earthly odor,
          whereat Hasché̆ltĭ had their charge taken out and washed with
          yucca-root suds.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Inside the hogán
          stood four large jewel posts upon which the gods hung their masks.
          The eastern post was of white shell, the southern of turquoise, the
          western of abalone, and the northern of jet. Two jewel pipes lay
          beside a god sitting on the western side of the hogán. These he
          filled with tobacco and lighted, passing one each to his right and
          his left. All assembled smoked, the last to receive the pipes being
          two large Owls sitting one on each side of the entrance way at the
          east. They drew in deep draughts of smoke and puffed them out
          violently. While the smoking continued, people came in from all
          directions. At midnight lightning flashed, followed by heavy
          thunder and rain, which Tónenĭlĭ, Water Sprinkler, sent in anger
          because he had not been apprised of the dance before it was time to
          begin it; but a smoke with the assembled Holy People appeased him.
          Soon after the chant began and continued until morning.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Some of the gods
          had beautiful paintings on deerskins, resembling those now made
          with colored sands. These they unfolded upon the floor of the hogán
          during the successive days of the <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">hatál</span></span>.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The last day of
          the dance was very largely attended, people coming from all holy
          quarters. Bĭlh Ahatí̆nĭ through it all paid close attention to the
          songs, prayers, paintings, and dance movements, and the forms of
          the various sacred paraphernalia, and<span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          him to return to his people long enough to perform it over his
          younger brother and teach him how to conduct it for people
          afflicted with sickness or evil. This he did, consuming nine days
          in its performance, after which he again joined the gods at
          Tsé̆gyiĭ, where he now lives. His younger brother taught the
          ceremony to his earthly brothers, the Navaho, who yet conduct it
          under the name of Kléjĕ Hatál, Night Chant, or Yébĭchai Hatál, The
          Chant of Paternal Gods.</p>

          Chant,—covering its nine days of performance, will give a
          comprehensive idea of all Navaho nine-day ceremonies, which combine
          both religious and medical observances. The myth characters
          personified in this rite are termed Yébĭchai, Grandfather or
          Paternal Gods. Similar personations appear in other ceremonies, but
          they figure less prominently.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">First
          Day</span></span>: The ceremonial, or medicine, hogán is built some
          days in advance of the rite. The first day's ceremony is brief,
          with few participants. Well after dark the singer, assisted by two
          men, makes nine little splint hoops—<span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">tsĭpa</span><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=

          yázhĕ kĕdán</span></span>—entwined with slip-cords, and places them
          on the sacred meal in the meal basket. Following this, three men
          remove their everyday clothing, take Yébĭchai masks, and leave the
          hogán. These three masked figures are to represent the gods
          Hasché̆ltĭ, Talking God, Haschĕbaád, Goddess, and Hasché̆lapai,
          Gray God. When they have gone and passed to the rear of the hogán,
          the patient comes in, disrobes at the left of the centre, passes
          around the small fire burning near the entrance of the hogán, and
          takes his seat in the centre, immediately after which the singing
          begins. During the third song Hasché̆ltĭ enters with his
          cross-sticks—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Hasché̆ltĭ balíl</span></span>—and opens and
          places them over the patient's body, forcing them down as far
          toward the ground as<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page117">[pg
          117]</span><a name="Pg117" id="Pg117" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          possible. The second time he places them not so far over the body;
          the third, not lower than the shoulders; the fourth time, over the
          head only, each time giving his peculiar call, <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Wu-hu-hu-hu-u!</span></span> Then Hasché̆ltĭ
          takes up a shell with medicine and with it touches the patient's
          feet, hands, chest, back, right shoulder, left shoulder, and top of
          head,—this being the prescribed ceremonial order,—uttering his cry
          at each placing of the medicine. He next places the shell of
          medicine to the patient's lips four times and goes out, after which
          Haschĕbaád comes in, takes one of the circle <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">kĕdán</span></span>,
          touches the patient's body in the same ceremonial order, and
          finally the lips, at the same time giving the slip-cord a quick
          pull. Next comes Hasché̆lapai, who performs the same incantations
          with the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">kĕdán</span></span>. Again Hasché̆ltĭ enters
          with the cross-sticks, repeating the former order, after which he
          gives the patient four swallows of medicine,—a potion different
          from that first given,—the medicine-man himself drinking what
          remains in the shell. This closes the ceremony of the first day.
          There will, perhaps, be considerable dancing outside the hogán, but
          that is merely practice for the public dance to be given on the
          ninth night. The singer and the patient sleep in the hogán each
          night until the nine days are passed, keeping the masks and
          medicine paraphernalia between them when they sleep.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Second
          Day</span></span>: Just at sunrise the patient is given the first
          ceremonial sweat. This is probably given more as a spiritual
          purification than in anticipation of any physical benefit. To the
          east of the hogán a shallow hole is dug in the earth, in which are
          placed hot embers and ashes,—covered with brush and weeds, and
          sprinkled with water,—upon which the patient takes his place. He is
          then well covered with blankets. The medicine-man, assisted by
          Hasché̆ltĭ and Haschĕbaád, places about the patient a row of
          feathered <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">kĕdán</span></span>, and then commences to
          sing while the patient squirms on the hot, steaming bed. After
          singing<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page118">[pg
          118]</span><a name="Pg118" id="Pg118" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          certain songs the medicine-man lifts the blanket a little and gives
          the patient a drink of medicine from a ceremonial basket. He is
          again covered, and the singing goes on for a like time. Later the
          blankets are removed and Hasché̆ltĭ and Haschĕbaád perform over the
          patient, after which he goes to the hogán. The brush and weeds used
          for the bed are taken away and earth is scattered over the coals.
          This sweating, begun on the second day, is repeated each morning
          for four days: the first, as above noted, taking place east of the
          hogán, and the others respectively to the south, west, and north.
          The ceremonies of the second night are practically a repetition of
          those held the first night. During the third song Hasché̆ltĭ enters
          with the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Hasché̆ltĭ balíl</span></span>, placing it
          four times in the prescribed order and giving his call; then he
          goes out, re-enters, and takes from the medicine basket four sacred
          reed <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">kĕdán</span></span>. These he carries in
          ceremonial order to the four cardinal points: first east, then
          south, next west, lastly north. Next stick <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">kĕdán</span></span>
          are taken out of the basket, which holds twelve each of the four
          sacred colors. These also are carried to the four cardinal
          points—white, east; blue, south; yellow, west; black, north. After
          all the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">kĕdán</span></span> are taken out, Hasché̆ltĭ
          again enters with the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Hasché̆ltĭ balíl</span></span>, using it in
          directional order and giving medicine as on the night

          around the wrists, arms, ankles, legs, and body, and fastened on
          the head in the form of a turban. After several songs, Nayé̆nĕzganĭ
          and Tobadzĭschí̆nĭ cut the boughs from the body, using a stone
          arrow-point as a knife. Then the boughs are cut into fragments over
          the patient's head, after which the singer takes a feather wand,
          points it toward the four cardinal points above the fire, and
          brushes the patient, chanting meanwhile. At the end of the brushing
          he points the wand out of the smoke-hole, at the same time blowing
          the dust from it out into the open air.</p>

          dress and go out. The patient disrobes and takes his place. The
          assisting medicine-man digs a small hole just between the patient's
          feet, and encircles it with a line of <span class=

          opening to the east, after which the patient dons a mask.
          Hasché̆ltĭ enters, followed by Haschĕbaád, who carries a small
          spruce tree. The former puts sacred pollen in the hole four times,
          each time giving his call; then Haschĕbaád plants the tree in the
          hole and fastens its top to the patient's mask; the mask is then
          pulled off the patient's head by his jerking quickly away from the
          tree. This is the first night in which the ceremonies are continued
          until dawn. After the unmasking, the singers take their place at
          one side of the back of the hogán and begin singing to the
          accompaniment of a basket drum. A youth and a maiden are required
          to sit in the hogán throughout the fourth night, the ritual
          requiring that these be persons who have not had sexual
          knowledge.</p>

          about four feet, and is placed close to the back of the hogán.
          There are three figures in the painting: the central one being the
          patient, the one to the left Hasché̆ltĭ, the one to the right
          Haschĕbakú̆<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "vertical-align: super">n</span></span>. Around this painting, at
          all sides except the eastern, feather wands, <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ndiá</span></span>,
          are stuck in the ground; in this case twelve in number. Foot-tracks
          are made in the sand with white meal. Hasché̆ltĭ and
          Haschĕbakú̆<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "vertical-align: super">n</span></span> dress ceremonially, mask,
          and go out, after which the patient enters and takes his position
          on the central figure of the dry-painting, facing the east. The
          effort this night is to frighten the patient and thus banish the
          evil spirits<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page120">[pg
          120]</span><a name="Pg120" id="Pg120" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          from his body. The two maskers come running in, uttering weird,
          unearthly howls, in which every spectator in the hogán joins,
          feigning great fear. The masked figures make four entries, each
          like the other. In many cases the patient either actually faints
          from fright or feigns to do so. The patient then leaves the
          dry-painting and it is destroyed. None of the sand or other
          pigments used in this painting is applied to the patient's body, as
          is done with that of later paintings. The next part of the fifth
          night's ceremony is the initiation of new members into the Yébĭchai
          order. No one who is not a member of the order is allowed to enter
          the ceremonial hogán. At the time of the initiation Hasché̆ltĭ and
          Haschĕbakú̆<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "vertical-align: super">n</span></span> are outside in the
          darkness. The initiates enter and sit on the ground in a row—the
          males naked, the women dressed in their ordinary mode. They dare
          not look up, for should they see Hasché̆ltĭ before being initiated,
          they would become blind. One at a time these novices take their
          place in the centre of the hogán and the initiatory rite is
          performed over them.</p><a name="fig114" id="fig114"></a>

            pictured the second dry-painting employed in the Night Chant,
            made on the sixth day of the ceremony. It represents crossed logs
            which whirl around in a mythic lake. Upon them are alternately
            seated male and female deities, singing. The light figures are
            goddesses, <span class="tei tei-hi" style=

            Their songs treat of all life-giving plants, of which corn,
            beans, squashes, and tobacco, the most important, are pictured as
            growing from the very centre of the lake, the point of contact of
            the logs.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style=
            "text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of the four marginal
            figures the one in white toward the east is Hasché̆ltĭ, Talking
            God, with his pine-squirrel pouch of sacred meal. Opposite him
            stands Haschógan, House God. The other two are Gá<span class=
            "tei tei-hi" style="text-align: center"><span style=
            "vertical-align: super">n</span></span>askí̆dĭl, Hunchbacks, Gods
            of Harvest, with seeds of the field in packs on their backs.
            Around the whole is the personified rainbow.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style=
            "text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the dry-painting
            is in actual use the patient enters upon it over the feet of
            Hasché̆ltĭ and sits at the intersection of the logs. A man
            personating a god then enters, places his hands upon the various
            parts of the many deities represented in the picture, then upon
            the corresponding parts of the patient's body. The whole picture
            is then destroyed and the colored sands are carried off to the
            north in a blanket and strewn under trees.</p>
          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sixth
          Day</span></span>: This is the first day of the large
          dry-paintings. The painting is commenced early in the morning, and
          is not finished until mid-afternoon. The one on this day is the
          whirling log representation. After it is finished, feathers are
          stuck in the ground around it, and sacred meal is scattered on
          parts by some of the assisting singers. Others scatter the meal
          promiscuously; one of the maskers uses a spruce twig and medicine
          shell, applying meal to every figure and object in the painting.
          Then the medicine-men all gather up portions of the sacred meal,
          putting it in their medicine pouches. The patient soon enters and
          takes his seat in the centre of the painting. The usual
          incantations are gone through, after which the colored sands of the
          painting are applied to the corresponding parts of the patient's
          body, then gathered up and carried off to the north. During the day
          two sets of beggars go out to the neighboring hogáns. These
          personate Hasché̆ltĭ, Tónenĭlĭ—Water Sprinkler, the God of Water,
          who is really a clown—and as many Haschĕbaád as care to go out. The
          beggars carry whips made of yucca<span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page121">[pg 121]</span><a name="Pg121" id="Pg121" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> leaves, and one who does not respond to their
          appeals for gifts is whipped,—if he can be caught,—which creates a
          great deal of amusement. The personators act like a company of
          clowns, but at the same time they gather a large quantity of food.
          When the day is thoroughly taken up with dry-painting and
          ceremonies, there is less of the ceremonial at night. The
          medicine-men, to the accompaniment of the basket drum, sing for a
          short time only on this sixth night, while outside the late evening
          is spent in dancing by those who are later to participate in the
          closing dance.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Seventh
          Day</span></span>: This day is practically consumed with the making
          of another large dry-painting. The masked men go out on another
          begging tour, also, and the medicine ceremonies and the destroying
          of the dry-painting are practically the same as those of the day
          before, while during the evening the medicine-men sing to the
          accompaniment of the drum.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Eighth
          Day</span></span>: The dry-painting is finished about three o'clock
          in the afternoon. After its completion there is a large open-air
          initiation. To become a full member of the Yébĭchai order one must
          first be initiated in the hogán; the second initiation is a public
          one; the third, another inside the hogán; the fourth, another in
          the open. These different initiation ceremonies, the same in point
          of ritualism, may be carried over several years.</p>

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> a distance the Indians have been
          gathering during the two previous days, and the hospitality of the
          patient's family, as well as that of all the people living in the
          neighboring hogáns, is taxed to the utmost. And from early morning
          until dark the whole plain is dotted with horsemen coming singly
          and in groups. Great crowds gather at the contests given half a
          mile from the hogán, where horse-races, foot-races, groups of
          gamblers, and throngs of Indians riding wildly from race-track to
          hogán fill the day with hilarity and incidents memorable to all.
          Toward the end of the day preparation is made for the closing part
          of the nine-day rite. Great quantities of fuel have been brought
          from the distant plateau, and placed in many small piles at each
          side of the smooth dance ground to the east of the hogán. As soon
          as it is dark the fuel is ignited, making two long lines of
          camp-fires, furnishing both light to see the dancers and warmth to
          the spectators, for the Yébĭchai cannot be held until the autumn
          frosts begin, when the nights have the sharp, keen air of the high
          altitudes.</p><a name="fig115" id="fig115"></a>

            the dry-paintings used in the Night Chant, being destroyed on the
            night of the eighth day's ceremonies. It takes its name from the
            fact that the principal characters represented in it, the dark
            figures, are all Zahadolzhá, Fringe-mouth Gods. According to the
            myth underlying the rite these gods made the first paintings of
            this sort used among the spirit people, and were the ones who
            furnished succor to the patients on the eighth day of the nine
            days' healing ceremony. The light figures are female
            deities—haschĕbaád. In the centre is the cornstalk, a life-giving
            symbol, and partially encircling the whole is the personified
            light-giving rainbow, a female personage.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style=
            "text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1.00em">During the ceremony a
            man masked as a Zahadolzhá places his hands first upon a part of
            his likeness pictured in colored earths and then on the
            corresponding part of the patient, as head, body, and limbs.
            Later the colored earths or sands are carried away in a blanket
            and placed under brush or trees toward the north.</p>
          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With the
          gathering darkness the human tide flows toward the medicine hogán,
          illuminated in the dusk by the long lines of camp-fires. All gather
          about and close around the dance square, having to be kept back by
          those in charge. Men, women, and children sit on the ground near
          the fires. Many on horseback have ridden up, and form a veritable
          phalanx back of the sitting spectators. The dance does not begin at
          once, and those assembled spend the time telling stories, jesting,
          and gossiping. Belated arrivals make coffee, or do hurried cooking
          around the fires.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Some distance to
          the east of the dance ground is a brush enclosure where the dancers
          prepare for their part in the rite. There, too, is a fire for light
          and warmth. The men in preparation remove all clothing, save short
          kilts, and paint their bodies with a mixture of water and white
          clay. Anyone who may have experienced the enjoyment of a sponge
          bath out in the open on a cold, windy night can appreciate the
          pleasure of the dance preparation. The dancers are impersonators of
          Navaho myth<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page123">[pg
          123]</span><a name="Pg123" id="Pg123" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          characters, twelve usually taking part. No qualifications are
          necessary other than that the participant be conversant with the
          intricate ritual of the dance. The dance continues throughout the
          entire night, one group of men being followed by another. The first
          twelve men dance through four songs, retiring to the dressing
          enclosure for a very brief rest after each. Then they withdraw, and
          twelve others dance for a like period, and so on. The first group
          sometimes returns again later, and the different groups vie with
          one another in their efforts to give the most beautiful dance in
          harmony of movement and song, but there is no change in the step.
          The several sets have doubtless trained for weeks, and the most
          graceful take great pride in being pronounced the best dancers. The
          first group of grotesquely masked men is ready by nine or ten
          o'clock; they file into the dance enclosure led by Hasché̆ltĭ,
          their naked, clay-painted bodies glinting in the firelight. While
          wearing masks the performers never speak in words; they only sing
          or chant. To address one in conversation would incur the
          displeasure of the gods and invite disaster. Time is kept by the
          basket drum and the rhythm of the singing.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The white
          visitor will get his best impression of the dance from a short
          distance, and, if possible, a slight elevation. There he is in
          touch with the stillness of the night under the starry sky, and
          sees before him, in this little spot lighted out of the limitless
          desert, this strange ceremonial of supplication and thanksgiving,
          showing slight, if any, change from the same performance, held on
          perhaps the same spot by the ancestors of these people<span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page124">[pg 124]</span><a name="Pg124" id="Pg124"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> ages ago. As the night wears on the
          best group of dancers come out. They are, perhaps, from the Redrock
          country, or from some other far-away district, and have been
          practising for weeks, that they might excel in this dance. The most
          revered song of the Yébĭchai is the Bluebird song, which is sung at
          the approach of day, and is the closing act of the drama. With the
          last words, "<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Dóla anyí, dóla anyí</span></span>," the
          assembled multitude start for their homes, near and far, melting
          into the gray of the desert morn, and by the time the sun breaks
          above the horizon the spot which was alive with people a few hours
          before is wrapped in death-like stillness, not a soul being within
          range of the eye.</p><a name="fig116" id="fig116"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The ceremony
          celebrating maturity of girls among the Navaho is held generally on
          the fourth night after the first evidence of the maiden's entrance
          into womanhood. On the first morning following the moment of this
          change in life the girl bathes and dresses in her finest clothes.
          Later she stretches herself face downward on a blanket just outside
          the hogán, with her head toward the door. A sister, aunt, or other
          female relation, if any happen to be close at hand, or if not, a
          male relative other than her father, then proceeds symbolically to
          remould her. Her arms and legs are straightened, her joints
          smoothed, and muscles pressed to make her truly shapely. After that
          the most industrious and energetic of the comely women in the
          immediate neighborhood is called in to dress the girl's hair in a
          particular form of knot and wrap it with deerskin strings, called
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">tsĭklólh</span></span>. Should there be any
          babies or little tots about the home, the girl goes to them, and,
          placing a hand under each ear, successively lifts them by the neck,
          to make them grow faster. Then she darts off toward the east,
          running out for about a quarter of a mile and back. This she does
          each morning until after the public ceremony. By so doing she is
          assured of continuing strong, lithe, and active throughout

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The four days
          preceding the night of the ceremony are days of abstinence; only
          such foods as mush and bread made from corn-meal may be eaten, nor
          may they contain any salt. To indulge in viands of a richer nature
          would be to invite laziness and an ugly form at a comparatively
          early age. The girl must also refrain from scratching her head or
          body, for marks made by her nails during this period would surely
          become ill-looking scars. All the women folk in the hogán begin
          grinding corn on the first day and continue at irregular intervals
          until the night of the third, when the meal is mixed into batter
          for a large corn-cake, which the mother bakes in a sort of
          bean-hole outside the hogán.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The ceremony
          proper consists of little more than songs. A medicine-man is called
          upon to take charge, being compensated for his services with
          blankets, robes, grain, or other articles of value. Friends and
          neighbors having been notified, they assemble at the girl's hogán
          fairly early in the evening. When dusk has settled, the
          medicine-man begins his songs, singing first the twelve "hogán
          songs" of the Bahózhonchi. After he has finished, anyone present
          who so desires may sing songs taken from the ritual of the same
          order. This motley singing and hilarity continue until well toward
          sunrise, when the mother brings in a bowl of yucca suds and washes
          the girl's hair. Her head and hair are dried with corn-meal, after
          which the girl takes her last run toward the east, this time
          followed by many young children, symbolically attesting that she
          will be a kind mother, whom her children will always follow. The
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">hatálĭ</span></span>, or medicine singer,
          during her absence sings eight songs, generally termed the Racing
          songs. On her return the great corn-cake is brought in, cut, and
          divided among the assemblage, when all disperse, and the girl may
          once more loosen her hair and partake of any food she pleases.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Navaho
          marriage ceremony is always held at the home of the girl. When a
          young man wishes to marry the maid of his choice, he makes his
          desire known to his parents, when the father<span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page126">[pg 126]</span><a name="Pg126" id="Pg126"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> goes to the girl's parents and explains
          that his son would like to marry their daughter. The girl is then
          consulted, and if she be willing to marry the young man, the
          parents of the two open negotiations. A popular, pretty girl
          commands a considerably higher price than a plain one, though few
          are married for a smaller bonus than fourteen ponies and a silver
          belt. Horses, saddles, cattle, sheep and goats, and
          turquoise-studded silver ornaments are the usual media of exchange
          in matrimonial bargains. The arrangement of compensatory details,
          particularly the date of delivery of the articles for payment,
          often requires a considerable period of time and no little
          controversy. When finally completed, the date is set for the
          wedding, which takes place always at night.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The girl's
          mother fills a wedding basket with corn-meal mush, which figures
          prominently in the ceremony. About nine o'clock in the evening the
          wedding party assembles. Anyone may attend, and usually a goodly
          number is present. The young man and his bride take seats on the
          western side of the hogán, facing the doorway. On their right the
          male spectators sit in rows; on their left, the women. The girl's
          mother, however, does not enter, for a mother-in-law, even in the
          making, must not look upon her newly acquired son, nor he upon her,
          then or thereafter. To do so would occasion blindness, and general
          ill luck to either one or both parties.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The basket of
          mush and two wicker bottles of water are brought in and placed
          before the couple, the bearer being careful to see that the side of
          the basket on which the top coil terminates is toward the east. The
          girl's father then steps forward, and from his pouch of
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">tádĭtĭn</span></span>, or sacred pollen, sifts
          several pinches on the basket of mush. Beginning at the end of the
          coil on the eastern rim, he sifts straight across and back, then
          follows the rim with the pollen around to the south side, sifts
          across and back, and then drops a little in the centre. That done,
          the bride pours a small quantity of water from the wicker bottle
          upon the young man's hands. He washes and pours a little upon hers.
          Then from the side of the basket toward the east he dips out a
          little mush<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page127">[pg
          127]</span><a name="Pg127" id="Pg127" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          with two fingers and eats. The girl follows, dipping from the same
          place. This act is repeated at the three remaining sides—the south,
          west, and north,—and then the basket is passed to the assemblage,
          who finish eating its contents. The empty basket becomes the
          property of the young man's mother, who retains it as a sort of
          certificate of marriage. The washing of hands and the dipping of
          mush from the same spot is a pledge that the girl will follow in
          her husband's footsteps—doing as he does.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the
          ceremony is concluded, a supper is provided for all. General
          conversation and levity while away the hours, the talk consisting
          principally, however, of sage advice from relatives to both husband
          and wife as to how they should conduct themselves in future. At
          dawn the party disperses, the young man taking his bride with
          him.</p><a name="fig122" id="fig122"></a>

          "font-variant: small-caps">Dress</span></span>—The primitive dress
          of the men was deerskin shirt (<span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ĕpŭntltésĭs</span></span>),
          leggings (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">ĭsklé̆tlĭkai</span></span>), and moccasins
          (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">ĕpú̆nkĕ</span></span>). They were never
          without the loin-cloth, the one absolutely necessary feature of
          Indian dress. A deerskin cap (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">cha</span></span>), with attractive symbolic
          ornamentation, was worn; but for the greater part the headgear
          consisted of a band braided from the long leaves of the yucca,
          which they placed rather low on the head to keep the hair from the
          eyes. The dress of the Apache women consisted of a short deerskin
          skirt, high boot-legged moccasins, and a loose waist which extended
          to the hips and was worn outside the skirt. Both skirt and waist
          were ornamented with deerskin fringe and latterly with metal
          pendants. The men's hair always hangs loose; it is never braided.
          At time of mourning the hair is cut horizontally just above the
          shoulder line. Apache matrons, like the men, do not braid the hair,
          but let it hang loosely over the shoulders. The maidens tie their
          hair in a low long knot at the back of the head, to which is
          fastened a decorated deerskin ornament, denoting maidenhood. So
          arranged it is called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">pĭtsĭvé̆sti</span></span>, and the wrapping,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          dwelling consists of a dome-shaped frame of cottonwood or other
          poles, thatched with grass. Average diameter at the base, twelve
          feet. The house itself they term <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">kówa</span></span>;
          the grass thatch, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">palmillo</span></span>, is used exclusively in
          thatching. Since the institution of the Messiah religion the houses
          are built rather elongate in form, with a doorway in each end, and
          all the houses of the village are arranged in long rows. Doorways
          are termed <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">chogúntĭ</span></span>, interchangeably.
          Summer houses are generally built at a distance from the winter
          houses, in fact wherever the Apache would have occasion to stop,
          and are little more than brush shelters to afford temporary
          shade.</p>

          Foods</span></span>—No tribe is more capable of living on the
          natural products of their pristine haunts than the Apache. Whether
          allowed to live peacefully in the river valleys or driven in war to
          seek protection of impenetrable mountains, nature provided amply
          for their support; for practically all the flora and fauna
          indigenous to the Southwest are considered food by the Apache. (See

          is loosely woven of the stems of aromatic sumac, then coated inside

          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">tsa-naskú̆dĭ</span></span>, is much used in
          their domestic life. The most pretentious basket is the immense
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">tus-naskú̆di</span></span>, urn-shaped, like
          the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">tus</span></span>—whence its name—and used
          principally for the storage of grain. No Apache home is without the
          burden basket, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">tú̆tza</span></span>, round and deep, often

          Organization</span></span>—The Apache never had a very stable form
          of government. Chiefs were elected, or chosen, and ruled so long as
          it pleased their followers. If the son of a chief proved himself
          capable, he would be accorded opportunity to rule, otherwise he
          received no special recognition. Medicine-men were always more
          influential than the chiefs. Social customs and habits and much of
          the government of the tribe are guided by the medicine-men; but
          often they lose all influence by meeting with failure in the
          treatment of disease. Like the chiefs, the medicine-men depend on
          popular approval for their success.</p>

          speaking, barter for women at an agreed price was never the custom
          among the Apache,—so the older of the present generation
          contend,—personal choice on the part of the girl having always to
          be considered. Nevertheless, payment for the bride is always made
          to her parents in the form of grain, money, horses, saddles,
          blankets, or cattle. The bride's consent is necessary, custom
          requiring the young man to prove his moral strength, and ability to
          support a wife and himself, by erecting a neat house and permitting
          the girl of his choice to occupy it with him for four nights
          without being molested or having her presence observed. By
          preparing his breakfast the morning following the fourth night the
          girl acknowledges her willingness to marry, and the agreement as to
          the definite payment her parents shall receive may be made any time
          later. She then becomes the man's wife, though a month may
          sometimes elapse before the agreement is sealed and the consequent
          payment made.</p>

          Skhĭn, Pollen Boy. The creator next made the earth, and then the
          other gods of the Apache pantheon. Following their creation he
          instructed the various gods in their respective duties, and then
          disappeared into the sky through the smoke from a miraculous
          fire.</p>

          goddess, is the mother of two boys, who perform miracles and act as
          saviours of the people. The elder brother, Nayé̆nĕzganĭ, conceived
          by the Sun, is the more active and is revered as the God of War. To
          Tubadzĭschí̆nĭ, conceived by Water, is ascribed the making of the
          ocean as it now is, and he is supposed to have much to do with
          water in the form of rain and snow.</p>

          are invariably called "dances." Among these are: a rain dance, a
          puberty rite, a harvest or good-crop dance, and a spirit dance. The
          medicine dance is the creation of a medicine-man and varies with
          his individual views. The ceremonial paraphernalia of the other
          four dances may vary in accordance with the dictates of the
          medicine-man, but for the greater part follows prescribed formula.
          The Apache are devoutly religious and pray on many occasions and in
          various ways: sometimes with the aid of little images representing
          gods, sometimes with painted deerskins and caps, and sometimes by
          merely facing the cardinal points and scattering pollen to the four
          winds for the gods from whom they seek favor. Usually the plants
          employed by them as medicine are dug in a ceremonial way, one
          notable exception being the gathering of pollen, no prayers being
          offered at that time. In secluded spots in the hills and mountains
          are found round cairns, with cedar and other twigs deposited upon
          them. These are shrines at which the Apache make offerings to their
          favorite gods. The medicine ceremonies are very numerous and vary
          with the dreams and personal views of the medicine-man who conducts
          them.</p>

          "font-variant: small-caps">Burial</span></span>—Everywhere
          throughout the hills and mountains of the reservation one finds
          small heaps of stones. In most instances these mark Apache graves.
          A favorite place of burial is a<span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          placed by the deceased's relatives and covered with stones. These
          small stones are always deposited one at a time, the Apache
          believing that to put them on the body all at once would shorten
          the life of the one so doing. Infants are usually placed on the
          upper branches of large cedar or piñon trees. The child is wrapped
          in its carrier, or cradle-board, which is left face up and covered
          with any sort of cloth, the belief being that the souls of infants

          Formerly horses were killed beside the grave of the dead, that they
          might use them in the after-world. For the same reason wearing
          apparel was also placed at the grave, together with available
          articles of adornment and accoutrement.</p>

          loin-cloth. In winter a large loose deerskin coat was worn in
          addition. The women wore a waist open at the sides under the arms,
          a deerskin skirt falling below the knees, and legging-moccasins
          with very high tops. About the waist the women now also wear a very
          broad leather belt, ten to sixteen inches in width, extending well
          up under the arms. The men wear their hair in braids hanging over
          the shoulders and wound with strips of deerskin. Formerly they wore
          bangs in front on a line with the cheek-bones and tied their hair
          in a knot at the back of the head, as the Navaho and the Pueblo
          Indians do. The women part their hair down the middle, bring it to
          the sides of the head, and tie it with strips of deerskin, cloth,
          or yarn.</p>

          this not only enters largely into their domestic life, but was
          formerly the principal article of barter with their Pueblo
          neighbors and Navaho kindred. Some pottery is made, practically all
          of which is in the form of small cooking utensils. The large clay
          water jar was not used, their wandering life necessitating a water
          carrier of greater stability.</p>

          origin when a part of the tribe remained for a period on the plains

          dressed in deerskin shirts, hip-leggings, moccasins, and native
          blankets. These were superseded by what has been the more universal
          costume during the present generation: close-fitting cotton or
          velvet shirt, without collar, cut rather low about the neck and
          left open under the arms; breeches fashioned from any pleasing, but
          usually very thin, material, and extending below the knees, being
          left open at the outer sides from the bottom to a little above the
          knees; deerskin moccasins with rawhide soles, which come to a
          little above the ankles, and brown deerskin leggings from
          moccasin-top to knee, held in place at the knee by a woven garter
          wound several times around the leg and the end tucked in. The hair
          is held back from the eyes by a head-band tied in a knot at the
          back. In early times the women wore deerskin waist, skirt,
          moccasins, and blanket, but these gradually gave place to the
          so-called "squaw-dress," woven on the blanket loom, and consisting
          of two small blankets laced together at the sides, leaving
          arm-holes, and without being closed at top or bottom. The top then
          was laced together, leaving an opening for the head, like a poncho.
          This blanket-dress was of plain dark colors. To-day it has
          practically disappeared as an article of Navaho costume, the
          typical "best" dress of the women now consisting of a velvet or
          other cloth skirt reaching to the ankles, a velvet shirt-like waist
          cut in practically the same manner as that of the men, and also
          left open under the arms. Many silver and shell ornaments are worn
          by both sexes. The women part their hair down the middle and tie it
          in a knot at the back.</p>

          In its most substantial form it is constructed by first planting
          four heavy crotch posts in the ground; cross logs are placed in the
          crotches, and smaller ones are leaned from the ground to these, the
          corner logs being longer, forming a circular framework, which is
          covered with brush and a heavy coating of earth. The entrance is
          invariably at the east. The building of a hogán and its first
          occupancy are attended with ceremony and prayer. For the great
          nine-day rites hogáns like those used as dwellings, but larger, are
          built. Generally they are used for the one occasion only, but in
          localities where there are very few trees the same ceremonial hogán
          may be used for a generation or more. For summer use a brush
          shelter, usually supported by four corner posts and sometimes
          protected by a windbreak, is invariably used, supplanting a once
          common single slant shelter.</p>

          ceremonial baskets being manufactured by neighboring tribes. The
          Navaho are also skilful silversmiths, having learned the art of
          metal-working from the Spaniards. Their first work of this
          character, however, was in iron, but this was superseded by the
          more easily worked silver. Some pottery is made, but it is rather
          crude in form, black in color, and without decoration.</p>

          Organization</span></span>—The government of the Navaho is rather
          loose; indeed, inasmuch as they have no head-chief strictly such,
          it may be said that they have no <span class=

          government. Their code of ethics and morals is governed almost
          entirely by their religious beliefs. There is always a man who is
          denominated the head-chief, but his influence is seldom much
          greater than that of any one of the many subordinate chiefs who are
          the recognized heads of small groups only.</p>

          through the mother, and a man and a woman belonging to the same
          clan may not marry. There are also related clans, forming
          phratries, within which marriage<span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          "tei tei-anchor"></a> is also prohibited by tribal custom. In the
          Navaho creation myth it is related that four pairs of men and women
          were made by Yólkai Ĕstsán at her home beyond the western ocean,
          whence they migrated eastward, far inland, joining others of their
          kind created but a short time previously. Each parent pair was
          given a sacred jewel wand with which to bring water from the earth
          if no springs were found during the journey. The first man brought
          water with ease, remarking, "The water is close," owing to which
          circumstance he came to be termed To Ahánĭ, Water Is Close. In a
          similar way the other three pairs received the names of To Dĭchínĭ,
          Bitter Water; Hashklí̆shnĭ, Mud; and Kĭnya Ánĭ, Houses in the
          Cliffs. It required four days to make the journey from the ocean to
          what was to be their homeland. On the first day children were born
          to the several pairs; they matured by nightfall and camped apart
          from the parents as though they were not of kin, and received in
          turn a family name derived from their camp surroundings, from
          peculiarity of dress or form, or from remarks they made. These in
          turn bore children on the following day, who gave birth to others
          on the third. Thus were produced three new generations from each
          parent pair. All these then became clanship groups bearing names
          now applied to various Navaho clans. The four generations,
          including the original pairs, formed phratries, which have no
          names. The clans in each phratry in the order of generations are as
          follows:</p>

          from the salt lakes to the south, heading the Ashĭhín clan. People
          from Jemez formed the Mai Dĕshkís, or Coyote Pass, clan; Apache
          from the Cibicu cañon, the Dĕschínĭ clan, or Red-light People, and
          families from Zuñi the Nashtĕzhé̆, Blackened Eyebrows, clan, and
          Tŭh'chínĭ, Red Heads, clan, so called from their painted faces and
          bodies. There are numerous other clanship groups derived from
          adopted peoples now recognized as being distinctly Navaho; the
          first sixteen clans here named are accepted in the tribe as being
          strictly Navaho in origin.</p>

          are also many less important ceremonies occupying four days, two
          days, and one day in their performance. In these ceremonies many
          dry-paintings, or "sand altars," are made, depicting the characters
          and incidents of myths. Almost every act of their life—the building
          of the hogán, the planting of crops, etc.—is ceremonial in nature,
          each being attended with songs and prayers.</p>

              differ as to the number of worlds through which the progenitors
              of the Navaho passed. Some give three before this one, others
              but one. The version adopted by the Bahozhonchí, a religious
              order or medicine society whose rites and ceremonies are the
              oldest and most widely known of any in the tribe, treats of two
              worlds only: the one below, from which the Dĭgí̆n, or Holy
              People, migrated in the form of insects, birds, and beasts, and
              to which the dead return; and the present, into which was born
              man in his present image, created of pollen, corn, white shell,
              turquoise, and rain by the Dĭgí̆n. These Dĭgí̆n were the
              animals which never assumed absolute material form on this
              earth, and the gods who perfected the creation. The creation of
              the world below, together with all food products, plant life,
              and animals known to the Navaho, is credited to First Man and
              First Woman, Ástsĕ Hástĭn and Ástsĕ Ĕstsán; but the myth does
              not go back to that creation, nor, save for the plant and
              animal life and a little earth used in making mountains, does
              it assume the use of any part of the underworld in the making
              or completion of this. So far as the inhabitants now found in
              the image of man are concerned, they were made, and first
              existed, on this earth, and did not develop from a lower

              the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</span></h2>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Project
              Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread
              public support and donations to carry out its mission of
              increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that
              can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible
              by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment.
              Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important
              to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
              Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
              charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the
              United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it
              takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to
              meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit
              donations in locations where we have not received written
              confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the
              status of compliance for any particular state visit <a href=
              "http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate" class=
              "tei tei-xref">http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate</a></p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While we
              cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
              have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no
              prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors
              in such states who approach us with offers to donate.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
              International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot
              make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations
              received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp
              our small staff.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Please check
              the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods
              and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways

              Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
              editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the

              necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
